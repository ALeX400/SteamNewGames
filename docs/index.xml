<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fkaguragames" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Steam_Page_Discord-EN.png?t=1706333872"/></a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_1_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/>Alice is a promising young alchemist in the Alchemists' Fellowship, and she has it all. She has a prestigious job, she just got her own house, and the fellowship pays her a monthly stipend... Or it did, before it kicked her out for failing her annual review. Alice's only means of getting reinstated is to complete one of the quests she's been given.<br/><br/>With multiple main quests to choose from, it's up to you how Alice goes about getting her job back!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_2_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/>Each of the main quests issued by the Alchemists' Fellowship involves different methods of playing the game. Will you brave the dungeon area and all of its turn-based RPG action to bring the fellowship proof of your prowess? Will you elect to go the farming route and grow mythical crops in your garden? Will you gather the resources you need to expand your home beyond what contemporary craftsmanship allows? Or will you spend your time fishing for a legendary lunker?<br/><br/>No two routes play exactly the same, and you can take on whichever you want‚Äîor even all of them at once‚Äîwhile also completing optional quests for a variety of townsfolk.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_3_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_01_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_02_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_4_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><strong>Multiple Ways to Play</strong><br/>No two main quests play the same. You can enjoy a traditional turn-based RPG or complete quests that involve no combat at all.<br/><br/><strong>Mercenaries for Hire</strong><br/>If you choose to challenge the game's dungeons, you can hire your choice of four mercenaries to go along with you. Each one has her own unique talents, so you can enjoy building a party of two that suits your combat style!<br/><br/><strong>Pacifist Routes</strong><br/>Several of the game's main quests focus on different kinds of gathering, and thus can be completed without ever seeing a battle screen. If you like to relax with a fishing rod or a pickaxe in hand, Alchemist Quest has you covered!<br/><br/><strong>The Tower of Ordeals</strong><br/>For those who love a challenge, there's a gauntlet of brutal post-game battles waiting to test your mettle after the credits roll!						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Phantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...<br/><br/>The cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Asynchronous Multiplayer</h2>Explore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you and use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped. Watch and learn from the mistakes of up to 20 phantoms including your Steam friends that have attempted the same temple and steal their whips as they fall.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlock More Treacherous Floors</h2>Recover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.<h2 class="bb_tag">Blessings from the Gods</h2>As adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlockable Whips</h2>Unlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">Social Connections</h2>Players can share Temple Codes for their failed runs allowing friends to attempt the same temple or share their Adventure Code which yields a playlist of temples that a player has attempted in the past.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705968827"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the BAORA9 production facility! Your goal is to <strong>collect items</strong> extracted from the facility and deliver them to <strong>reach the required quota</strong> for leaving the structure. Beware of the "local creatures," <strong>monsters that will raid the facility</strong> through the ventilation ducts during your work sessions. Each level features a different creature, <strong>each requiring a unique approach to survive</strong>. Use a <strong>limited battery scanner</strong> to detect monsters, managing it wisely to avoid being defenseless.<br/><br/>The facility is divided into three rings. You can close the doors of various zones to protect yourself and block local creatures during the game. Keep track of the number of managed zones, as losing too many will slow down item production, making it harder to reach the quota to abandon the structure.<br/><br/>Your survival depends on your intuition, wit, and skills. Can you find the right strategy, manage resources intelligently, and leave the BAORA9 production facility unscathed?						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							‚ñ≤ Combat!<br>
Removing zombies one by one with silenced firearms and close-in weapons will allow you to explore safely most of the time, but you will still inevitably encounter a wave of zombies roaming the streets, so don't let your guard down. If you have enough ammunition, try to use a heavy gun to clean up the enemy!<br>
Don't trust any survivors like you who came from other survivor camps to loot the city. They're more interested in ripping supplies off your hands than they are in a time-consuming search of the city, and humans are much scarier than zombies.<br>
‚ñ≤ Death!<br>
Once your character dies, you lose all the equipment and supplies you carry, so survival is the key to this game. When your character is killed, you might want to try your luck with scavengers team, who are experts in salvaging lost objects.<br>
‚ñ≤ Dark!<br>
Face the endless night of the zombie crisis, then feel your way through the darkness. But in the face of other survivors, night may be your weapon.<br>
‚ñ≤ Refit!<br/>
With more than 60 weapons and nearly 200 modified accessories, modify the strongest and most reliable weapons you like to shoot zombies!<br/>
‚ñ≤ Manage!<br/>
Irregular item size backpack system. There's always a lot of trash to pick up, so manage your backpack, ditch the worthless goods, and leave with what's really useful.<br/>
‚ñ≤ Explore!<br/>
Go to different city scenes and explore different buildings. Be careful with your ammo and supplies, and plan your escape time, once your ammo runs out you will not be able to leave the city alive.<br/>
‚ñ≤ Camp!<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Brief</h2>Octameta is a distinctive 3D puzzle game that immerses players in an enduring exploration of the enigmas of human science.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>In a world where human civilization has collapsed, you will take on the role of an intelligent being, reconstructing and comprehending the evolution of human technology by solving a symbolic two-layered Rubik's Cube composed of technological fragments. The main focus of the gameplay lies in deciphering the Rubik's Cube, while the secondary aspect involves solving puzzles in small-scale scenarios.<h2 class="bb_tag">Levels</h2>We have four civilization fragments to restore. Restoring the Rubik's Cube at each stage involves an in-depth exploration of scientific principles, such as polar coordinates (representing reproduction), Newtonian gravity (representing money), circuit theory (representing religion), and Fourier transform (representing power). Those principles not only embody the scientific progress of human history, but also reflect fundamental issues of human society.<h2 class="bb_tag">Epilogue</h2>Every significant advancement in the field of natural science made by humanity serves as a means of reinforcing the social structure. Despite originating from pure curiosity, it invariably veers off course due to the powerful inertia of the social system.<br/>This phenomenon recurs at every stage of human social evolution: from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalist private ownership. Mathematics is utilized for taxation, while the information exchange facilitated by the internet progressively erects firewalls and censorship. Those all results into class solidification.<br/><br/>Even if humanity ultimately transitions to extinction, the exploitation of the scientific impartial stance by a select few powerful individuals will turn everything established by science into a double-edged sword poised over all of humanity.						</div></div>]]></description>

The game has no specific way to play or end, your goal is to have a good time!<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2>The game is divided into several modes that allow you to build your dream sandbox. Build with the blocks available in the game, freely change their properties, and have fun with ragdolls.<h2 class="bb_tag">STEAM WORKSHOP</h2>The game has full Steam Workshop support. Download various ragdolls, blocks, weapons, maps, and much more! You can also create your own content using the included SDK and simple step-by-step instructions.<h2 class="bb_tag">FREE DLCs</h2>The game comes with 2 free expansions: <strong>Goofy Ahh Sounds</strong> and <strong>Blood and Gore</strong>, which significantly enhance the gaming experience (actually, just fart sounds and a bit of blood, but in my opinion, it's still a cool feature).<h2 class="bb_tag">JOE BIDEN</h2>Despite Joe Biden appearing on every third screenshot, this is NOT a game about Joe Biden... BUT (!) you can download his model from the Steam Workshop, and THEN it CAN be a game about Joe Biden... or someone else... do whatever you want, after all, that's what this game is all about.						</div></div>]]></description>

You have to hire guides, buy buses, open attractions so that customers are satisfied with the services of your company. Run advertising to attract new customers. Manage the company's finances. This city needs a good travel agency!<h2 class="bb_tag">Manage your agency's finances</h2>Clients contact your agency to get to know the city better. And after the trip they evaluate the agency. The assessment is influenced by the cost of the trip, the quality of the bus, the skill of the guide, whether the client‚Äôs interests are taken into account, and the design of the agency‚Äôs office. Therefore, it is necessary to select the price of the tour so that there is money for development, but also not to upset clients. If suddenly there is a miscalculation with financial planning, then the bank will come to the rescue.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2662080/extras/–±–∞–±–∫–∏.gif?t=1706283603"><h2 class="bb_tag">Buy new buses</h2>You can add several bus models to the agency's fleet.

Tourists who contact your agency also have their own interests. Some are interested in historical places, some in natural beauty, others are looking for spiritual inspiration. Therefore, it is advisable to plan the bus route so that all passengers find it interesting.<h2 class="bb_tag">Develop your team</h2>Guides are an important part of the travel agency team. Green novices come to work for your agency, but over time they will become cool professionals. During excursions, guides gain experience and grow in level. When you level up, you can choose a guide perk.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
