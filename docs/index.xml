      <title>Inkulinati</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/header_alt_assets_5.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Inkulinati</strong> is a turn-based strategy game inspired by medieval manuscripts. Draw your army of Beasts, and spill the ink of your enemy, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash hidden powers. Being a master of the quill isn’t easy, so make sure you’re focused and plan every move wisely. Embark on your journey and become the greatest Inkulinati of all time!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_2_CTBS_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Don’t let the looks fool you. Inkulinati is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre) <strong>Beasts</strong> to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects. And when these Beasts work in unison, a symphony of destruction, death, until the literal apocalypse will endure.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/BEASTS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>It’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. There are special, battle tide-turning actions performed by the <strong>Inkulinati Masters</strong> themselves - such as yourself! Use your unique Hand Actions to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. And to keep it more interesting, each Inkulinati Master can have their own set of Talents too that can help win the battle.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/HANDS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>But wait, there’s more. You will need to adapt your tactics to every battle. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. Look out for objects that are scattered all over the <strong>Battlefields</strong>, such as exploding Pots of Beans, travelling Hell’s Maws, Clouds of Blessings, and use them to your advantage. <br/><br/>And just when you think you have a handle on the battle, an <strong>Apocalyptic event</strong> can come in and flip all of your plans upside down. We’re talking fires, plagues, and the Memento Mori itself. However, when all hope is lost and you’re on the ropes, an Apocalypse might be just what you need to turn the tide in your favour.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/BATTLEFIELDS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>There are different difficulty levels to choose from depending on your cunningand know-how, so even younglings will be Inkulinati-Masters in due time. And for those that want to know the ins and outs, you can learn how to master it all in our <strong>Academy mode</strong>, where we teach you step-by-step all the nuances to win every battle. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_1_SPC_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Uncover the mystery and secrets of the Inkulinati and face such opponents as Hildegard, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! <br/><br/>The best adventures are those of your own. In Journey mode you will create and develop your own character. As any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Inkulinati character. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear or a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own. Express yourself!<br/><br/>On your journey you won’t just battle against other Inkulinati Masters. You will face untamed Wild Beasts, go against Beast Lairs, meet interesting characters such Bards and talking Geese, visit shops, scriptoriums, and loads more. It is one heck of an adventure!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/CAMPAIGN_MAP_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_3_PVPM_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Inkulinati will bring you back to the Golden Era of hot-seat mode. Face your friends, family, or foes, and decide who is the greatest Inkulinati Master in the house!<br/><br/>Choose your Army, Talents, Inkulianti Master, the Battlefield, and other criteria and options, and face a battle that will be remembered for the ages.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/DUELS.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_4_IRLM_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/DECK.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/957960/Inkulinati/" id="dynamiclink_1" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/957960/Inkulinati/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/01_Intro_Banner.png?t=1708520359"><br/><br/>From the top of Megacity S1-9, the Sovereign Khan rules with fists of iron and flesh. Beneath the city’s rotting foundations, a vengeful warrior embarks on a journey to murder him. 4 years prior to the events of Slave Zero, Slave Zero X brings new life to a world where horrific, living machines known as Slaves are primed to become the latest tools of war in humanity’s long and bloody history. A secret band of warriors known as The Guardians hope to stop these biomecha from being unleashed upon the world, but one swordsman among their ranks has a different idea: use the enemy’s own weapon against them. By merging with a stolen Slave Unit Prototype, Shou will become a furious Devil in pursuit of killing a false God.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/02_Features_Banner.png?t=1708520359"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/03_Killer-Combos.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>KILLER COMBOS:</strong> Use swift swordplay, explosive ordnance, and stylish combos against an army of meat and metal.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/05_Death-From-Above.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>DEATH FROM ABOVE:</strong> Air juggling, dashes, and frequent target switching allow for you to take down foes of any size while wall-jumping and platforming can help you outmaneuver your enemies.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/Graffiti_row_01.png?t=1708520359"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/07_Fight-For-Your-Life.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE:</strong> Conquer mini-bosses, set pieces, and climactic 1-on-1 encounters that offer intense challenges against unforgettable villains.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/09_Strength-is-Nothing.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>STRENGTH IS NOTHING WITHOUT CONTROL:</strong> Use the Training Room to hone precise and powerful moves to string together devastating attack sequences.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/Graffitti_Row_02.png?t=1708520359"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/11_Battle-to-the-Beat.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>BATTLE TO THE BEAT:</strong> A 90s-inspired soundtrack features heavy Drum’n’Bass and funky industrial music that adds to the thrill of combat.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/13_Feast-Your-Eyes.gif?t=1708520359"><br/><strong>FEAST YOUR EYES:</strong> A unique visual aesthetic combines nostalgic 2D sprites with an advanced lighting system and stylized 3D environments.<br/><br/><strong>THE END IS NEVER THE END:</strong> After completing the campaign, further challenges await in an expansive and frenetic ‘Crimson Citadel’ procedural challenge tower with an online high score leaderboard.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1903910/extras/15_Footer_Banner.png?t=1708520359"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2787970/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Unheroic Misfits is a small little story RPG about a kid trying to save their friend. You play as Loo, an insect-like humanoid who explores the yellow, blue, green, and red kingdoms, passing a series of trials by helping other characters overcome their psychological problems.<br>
<br>
I like to think of it as an RPG, but it’s almost like a visual novel or what I’ve termed interactive literature. Basically, if you’re looking for a traditional RPG experience, this might not be for you. But if you’re willing to try something new and read a lot of text, maybe you should give it a shot! There’s no fighting: the major interactions are exclusively dialogue-centric. There’s also only one ending, but feel free to interpret it however you’d like.<br>
<br>
The characters of Unheroic Misfits tend to alternate from goofy to philosophical, and sometimes both at the same time. There are lots of metaphors and symbolic elements: I wasn’t joking when I described it as interactive literature!<br>
<br>
Made in RPG Maker XP, the game lasts about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how many NPCs you choose to interact with. My hope is that experiencing Unheroic Misfits will be cathartic both for people who have struggled with mental health and for people trying to accept the loss of a loved one.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

This is game design based on psychology as much as rules.” </i><br/>- Quarter to Three<br/><br/><i>“More than any game I've played in years, Solium Infernum nails the sensation of staring at a screen and losing yourself in the cold glory of a difficult decision.”</i><br/>- Game Developer (formerly Gamasutra)<br/><br/><i>“Solium Infernum kicked my knees out from under me ... this game took my past experience with strategy games and threw it, like a pro basketball player, into a bin eighty feet away.”</i><br/>- Eurogamer<br/><br/><i>“One of the best games of the year.”</i><br/>— Three Moves Ahead<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_toReign.png?t=1708639070"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Inkulinati</strong> is a turn-based strategy game inspired by medieval manuscripts. Draw your army of Beasts, and spill the ink of your enemy, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash hidden powers. Being a master of the quill isn’t easy, so make sure you’re focused and plan every move wisely. Embark on your journey and become the greatest Inkulinati of all time!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_2_CTBS_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Don’t let the looks fool you. Inkulinati is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre) <strong>Beasts</strong> to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects. And when these Beasts work in unison, a symphony of destruction, death, until the literal apocalypse will endure.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/BEASTS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>It’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. There are special, battle tide-turning actions performed by the <strong>Inkulinati Masters</strong> themselves - such as yourself! Use your unique Hand Actions to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. And to keep it more interesting, each Inkulinati Master can have their own set of Talents too that can help win the battle.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/HANDS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>But wait, there’s more. You will need to adapt your tactics to every battle. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. Look out for objects that are scattered all over the <strong>Battlefields</strong>, such as exploding Pots of Beans, travelling Hell’s Maws, Clouds of Blessings, and use them to your advantage. <br/><br/>And just when you think you have a handle on the battle, an <strong>Apocalyptic event</strong> can come in and flip all of your plans upside down. We’re talking fires, plagues, and the Memento Mori itself. However, when all hope is lost and you’re on the ropes, an Apocalypse might be just what you need to turn the tide in your favour.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/BATTLEFIELDS_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/>There are different difficulty levels to choose from depending on your cunningand know-how, so even younglings will be Inkulinati-Masters in due time. And for those that want to know the ins and outs, you can learn how to master it all in our <strong>Academy mode</strong>, where we teach you step-by-step all the nuances to win every battle. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_1_SPC_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Uncover the mystery and secrets of the Inkulinati and face such opponents as Hildegard, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! <br/><br/>The best adventures are those of your own. In Journey mode you will create and develop your own character. As any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Inkulinati character. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear or a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own. Express yourself!<br/><br/>On your journey you won’t just battle against other Inkulinati Masters. You will face untamed Wild Beasts, go against Beast Lairs, meet interesting characters such Bards and talking Geese, visit shops, scriptoriums, and loads more. It is one heck of an adventure!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/CAMPAIGN_MAP_v2.gif?t=1708623493"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/957960/extras/steam_tittle_3_PVPM_EN.png?t=1708623493"><br/>Inkulinati will bring you back to the Golden Era of hot-seat mode.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In VSCS-II, newer technology tracks your every move, algorithms and automated systems reinforce societal issues, and something even worse lurks on the horizon. In the shadowed corners of the internet, groups of freedom-fighters on a secure network are rising to combat injustices, but their tactics vary. As a newcomer to this digital landscape, you'll have to utilize a modified '80s operating system to make contact with these factions, investigate the truth, and ultimately decide the fate of privacy in a world set on eradicating it.<h2 class="bb_tag">The VSCS-II</h2>In this alternate future, computer hardware is heavily restricted. The only exemption? A commercial flop from 1986: the <i>Stultusoft "Very Secure Computer System Mk.II"</i>; a computer known only for it's poor marketing and (ironically) terrible security. But in the modern day, the VSCS-II has gained new life. When wired to have internet connectivity and running the "LunaOS" operating system - built 40 years after the original system - the VSCS-II forms the backbone for small resistances that battle authoritarian measures.<h2 class="bb_tag">A Branching Narrative</h2>Actions in VSCS-II have lasting effects, both in the short term, and the long term. Whether it's participating in a heated debate, committing a criminal act, or simply planting a new idea in someone's head, the impacts of your actions may not be obvious... but they <i>will</i> have consequences.<h2 class="bb_tag">Choose a Side</h2>A colourful cast of characters contrasts the monochrome 1980s haze, with each character having their own stance on the ethics of privacy, security, and artificial intelligence. As your influence grows and others in hiding begin to trust you - who will you side with? Factions using the VSCS-II have distinct views on what should (and <i>shouldn't</i>) be done to fix their broken world, and who should (and <i>shouldn't</i>) get a say in it. The choice will end up in your hands as you carve a unique path through the story, culminating in one of four unique endings.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The days of your enemies are numbered in Your Shots Count, a game where you protect your village by using your bow and arrow, as well as your math abilities. And don't worry if you are not too confident yet in solving the math expressions from the game, as you can customize your gameplay experience and can practice only one of the math operations that the game has to offer, before selecting more, or selecting them all. You can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as square roots.<br/> <br/>Each enemy that comes towards you has a math expression above their heads, and three answers next to them. Select the right one in order to defeat them. <br/><br/>Your Shots Count is meant to be a way to practice and improve your math skills. Hopefully in a fun way.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>What is Jolly Rogers Pirates Rumble?</strong><br/>JRPR in short is an Action Arena fighting game. It is a local multiplayer shared screen game which needs at least 2 players locally to play. Players control different Pirates and compete to win! How do you win? Nice and easy, just push your enemies of the arena or figure out what do with your Pirate powers. Enjoy the rush and excitement while you discover things really fast.<br/><br/><strong>Game Modes and Gameplay:</strong><br/>Jolly Rogers: Pirates Rumble has multiple game modes. You can start off with either a FFA Deathmatch (personal favorite) or team up with one of your buddies and play against your other buddies. There are multiple ways to kill your enemies in Jolly Rogers: Pirates Rumble, from pushing them off the map to bumping into them and damaging them or using the different ultimate powers. Watch out for map specific traps and obstacles too! Each Pirate has their own set hit points and rage points. Filling up the rage meter helps you unleash your ultimate power which for certain is to make your friends flee. Each mode has a different map with different fruit power ups (mentioned below) and sometimes traps spawning randomly.<br/><br/>We currently have 5 modes (more in development)<br/>Free For All – Every Pirate to himself! Your friendship will definitely be tested in this mode!<br/>King of the Map – There can be only one true King even among the Pirates! Fight for the crown and dominate the map.<br/>Team Deathmatch – Team up and defeat the opponents!<br/>Capture the Flag – Classic team based CTF except you really need to watch where you step.<br/>Rum Run – But why is the Rum gone? Find out with your friends!<br/><br/><strong>Fruits and Power ups</strong> :<br/>Pick up fruits to get special power-ups, these powers are temporary and will make your Pirate powerful in special ways. They need to be activated precisely and fade away after a short while but fret not, these fruits spawn randomly until the session ends. <br/><br/>Use Y button (Xbox One controller) to activate a fruit after picking up. Some of the fruits are passive as well.<br/><br/>Listing couple of fruits below<br/><br/>Ice Fruit : On activating this fruit (next to them) your opponents are frozen for a short while. Use this time to strategically push them into traps or off the map.<br/><br/>Fire Fruit : Light your opponents on fire, the moment they come in contact with you!<br/><br/>There are more unique ones for you to discover. <br/><br/>Pirates and their powers :<br/><br/>JRPR has seven unique characters (implemented) to choose from, each character has unique ability which can be activated once the rage meter is full.<br/><br/>These ultimate abilities will help you 1 hit KO your opponents.						</div></div>]]></description>
