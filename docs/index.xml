<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702050756"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702050756"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702050756"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702050756"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702050756"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702050756"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702050756"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702050756"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Build Residential Rental lots in any livable World with up to 6 units per lot and households of up to 8 Sims per unit. Choose to live as a tenant or property owner in The Sims™ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack. Your Sim can now own and manage multiple Residential Rental lots or move into a home where they’re closer to their neighbors than ever (perfect for snooping!). From potlucks to evictions, there’s a lot to do and a bustling new world to do it in. Purchase through January 18 to get bonus items** to bring the Night Market home for your Sims.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Street Eats Digital Content</strong> — Bring night market flavor home with a grill cart, street umbrella, and fruit basket, available when you order from November 2 through January 18**.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>New Lot Type</strong> — New Residential Rental lots give you the chance to get creative with multi-family dwellings. Give your Sims a basement suite to rent out, a duplex to keep 2 families close, townhomes for multiple families, or even build apartments of up to 6 units (or more if you know the cheat). Each Residential Rental can be customized to your specifications.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Property Management</strong> — Property owner Sims can be present property managers, living among their tenants, or they can live in a separate residence while generating income from several property investments. If your Sim doesn’t want to manage the whole property, then perhaps the new Handyperson Career might be better suited to them. Property owners should keep their Unit Ratings high because, if they don’t, they could face consequences like a Tenant Revolt.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Closer Than Ever</strong> — Sims in Residential Rentals will inevitably get tangled up in each other’s lives. They’ll meet with other tenants at Social Events like a community potluck, in the garden, or other common areas at their Residential Rental, and have ample opportunity to discover their neighbor’s secrets by eavesdropping, snooping, or even breaking and entering. If you discover something juicy, you can blackmail other Sims for a bribe, too!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Bustling and Beautiful</strong> — One of the most iconic scenes Tomarang has to offer is the Night Market where your Sims will savor new foods and add unique objects such as the pressure cooker and electric kettle to their homes. As you explore the world, you might even see children playing new games of marbles and hopscotch or discover the 4 new traits and 4 new aspirations unique to For Rent.</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Gain access to the two upcoming major expansions for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader and save with the bundle price!<br>
<br>
1. Void Shadows<br>
(coming June 2024)<br>
<br>
The first major story expansion is all about the Rogue Trader's voidship, the life of its crew, and the threats lurking in its holds. Dive into a new epic story integrated into the main narrative, battle new enemies, and recruit a new companion — a death cult assassin. Explore new decks of your voidship, unlock new upgrade options, and master the mechanics of void combat. Meet new members of your crew on the bridge, such as the Astropath, the chirurgeon, and others.<br>
The events of this story will be reflected in the game's epilogue.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion offers 15 hours of gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Lex Imperialis<br/>
(coming December 2024)<br/>
<br/>
The second major story expansion sees the Lord Captain join forces with a new companion — a member of the Adeptus Arbites. As the past of House von Valancius begins to present itself in a new light, the Rogue Trader faces difficult decisions that may affect the future of the entire Koronus Expanse.<br/>
Over the course of this story, you will get a chance to learn more about the collection of the Imperial Tithe, otherwise known as the Grand Harvesting. Interfere with this fundamental process of the Imperium at your own peril. Discover new areas, game mechanics, and archetypes — and of course, encounter new horrors of the Immaterium.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion likewise offers 15 hours of gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>“All is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come”, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape’s audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. “Time ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles… but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh—don’t come too close, you don’t want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?” The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. “Ah, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see… something… several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots – what could all this mean?”<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1701355158"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that <strong>your Dungeon is well-secured</strong> by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you <strong>turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise</strong>.<br/><br/>But what is that noise? <i>“Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!”</i> The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. <strong>The Dwarves have arrived</strong> to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart.<br/><br/>Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now <strong>bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-1_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Everything is better with Dwarves™:</strong> The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-2_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>It makes your Dungeon great again:</strong> Dungeons are up to four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-3_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Ripe for the taking:</strong> The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-4_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>New and shiny:</strong> An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-5_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Minions, everywhere:</strong> The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-6_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Many ways to tell the story:</strong> A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-7_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Change the world:</strong> Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-8_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Work together, slay together:</strong> 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">FREEDOM IN CHAINS</h2><strong>Solomon's Link</strong> is a short (~20 minutes), experimental, story-driven, point-and-click, in which you serve unseen as both witness and guide to a pair of fugitives living out their first night of freedom after years behind bars. With two vastly different minds and two specialized sets of hands to work with, lead the escaped convicts through an industrial maze of fuse boxes and factory lines by leveraging each prisoner’s strengths to offset their partner’s mental and physical limits - not to mention, the limited reach of the chain that binds them together.<h2 class="bb_tag">PRISONERS’ DILEMMA</h2>In the process of their escape, jailbirds L.T. and R.T. broke free from their chain gang, but not from each other, leaving each of them bound to a criminal they hardly know, guilty of crimes they’d never learned. With no choice but to work together, yet no clue of each others’ intentions, each is left to weigh their mutual dependence for survival against the looming threat of betrayal, and balance the trust needed to move forward against the deceit necessary to stay safe. For better, or for worse - every word that is spoken, and every thought that goes unsaid, holds a chance to tip the scales.<h2 class="bb_tag">FLY ON THE WALL</h2>Justice is blind; you are more fortunate. Watch the world from above through the countless eyes of the factory’s security system, and hear the whispers of the concrete jungle with environmental sounds packed full of custom-made foley. Independently control R.T. and L.T. in both movement and conversations through simple, intuitive UI, stay immersed with menus designed to help you settle into the role of an investigative observer, and indulge in a fully-fledged original soundtrack to score it all.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOURCE CODE</h2>The source code for the game, together with all the assets, is available at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faarthificial-unity%2Ffoundations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/aarthificial-unity/foundations</a>.						</div></div>]]></description>

							"Abtos Covert man, I'm tellin' you. Easiest post there is, just a few nights and you're off the hook. Only the outpost, a small shrine and the rest of the forest can be seen...<br/><br/>What did you say? Strange shadows? Weird sounds? Paranormal activities? Those are just legends, bedtime stories man! There's no way there is stuff like that out there!"<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694230/extras/image1.gif?t=1702058439"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694230/extras/ezgif-3-33a921ebcf.gif?t=1702058439"><br/><br/><strong>Abtos Covert</strong> is a survival horror game in which you play the role of a soldier keeping guard on a remote outpost out in the woods. You must keep your wits while searching for the truth. Fend off the mysterious entities attacking the outpost and find clues from previous soldiers who had the same shift and survived every night. Things will only get harder as you progress, so stay vigilant. Can you survive every night and discover the truth behind the stories, or will you become part of the legend?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694230/extras/ezgif-2-8948ff397e.gif?t=1702058439"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Deep forest setting: your hauntingly realistic battlefield.<br/></li><li> Unique equipment: alarms, spotlights, lockers for hide-and-seek.<br/></li><li> Eerie soundscapes: listen to tell where the danger lurks.<br/></li><li> Varied threats: each enemy has a unique pattern.

You drew the short straw and now you are to be stationed in the Abtos Covert outpost, a place commonly known for being quiet. But the moment it actually happens, the rest of the platoon is whispering: "Haven't you heard the stories?", "...heard someone disappeared there...". <br/><br/>The stories about that place are innumerable. Human sacrifices, shadows running in the trees and souls still lost that sing a dreary song. When you ask your superior, he just laughs it off...<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694230/extras/ezgif-1-80610ac8da.gif?t=1702058439"><br/><br/>In Abtos Covert, the gameplay is an immersive blend of psychological tension and strategic survival. Your primary objective: survive the night. You are equipped with just cameras and motion sensors to alert you to the horrors that stalk the night. Make quick decisions: use your spotlight to reveal threats or hide and pray you're overlooked. Listen for distinctive enemy sounds; each one requires a different survival strategy. With limited power, every choice you make could plunge you into lethal darkness. Each night grows more terrifying, forcing you to adapt, strategize, and confront the haunting truth that looms in the shadows. Will you survive, or become the next cautionary tale?<br/><br/>    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FxJ9DqKNc72" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694230/extras/image2.png?t=1702058439"/></a> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F5meE9AryFc" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/GrandmaDiscordSteam.png?t=1702054809"/></a><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Buckets1.png?t=1702054809"><h2 class="bb_tag">About Garbage Crew!</h2>Garbage Crew! is a game about chaos! You work in a team with two to four players and an angry garbage truck driver. Your job is to empty garbage cans and containers. Sadly, your contract doesn't state what kind of work you are required to do, so your boss loads you with all kinds of extra tasks, including firefighting and forest work. Naturally you are completely understaffed, and your short-tempered driver has no intention of stopping the truck to wait for you, just because you couldn't empty all the garbage cans while extinguishing a raging wildfire. Luckily, there are heaps of powerups that help you with all those tasks, so your stress level won't reach dangerous heights... Or so you thought! Due to an accident in your bosses DIY time reverting device, you travel back into medieval times with seemingly no way to return and to make matters worse, your contract states that you are still required to work! So better get yourself a sword because the town is in the middle of a siege!<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Timetravel.jpg?t=1702054809"><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br/>Garbage Crew! is a roguelike, action, couch-coop game, where, to archive victory, you and your team must make a fight plan on how to coordinate your operation to complete all incentives and make it to the level goal in time. Don't worry if you need a few tries, you’ll earn money with every run, so you and your friends can choose from a lot of different powerups that will help you in your next playthrough! While in game all kinds of unexpected events occur so make sure you come prepared to adapt to all circumstances! After all, you are doing like 5 jobs at the same time, all while the town is actively besieged!<br/><br/>The game features endless randomized levels in two completely different settings each with a lot of unique mechanics to make every run a new challenge! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Shop.jpg?t=1702054809"><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer Only!</h2>In Garbage Crew! you need to communicate and cooperate to bring order into chaos. Workplace regulations wouldn’t allow for only one person to shoulder all those responsibilities, so please bring at least one friend to keep those pesky lawyers away. Don’t worry if the size of your couch isn’t sufficient to fit all your friends, the game fully supports Steam Remote Play Together so everyone can play from everywhere in the world!<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Group.jpg?t=1702054809"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Endless Random Levels</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Two completely different settings</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Local Coop</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Online Coop via Steam Remote Play Together</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Tons of powerups</strong><br/></li><li><strong>All the jobs you’ve always wanted to try… at once!</strong><br/>- Waste Collector<br/>- Firefighter<br/>- Forrest worker<br/>- Knight<br/>- Truck Driver<br/>- Car Mechanic (Or at least someone that pushes a truck uphill)<br/></li><li><strong>50+ Different Skins</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Play a level with a custom seed or with custom difficulty</strong></li></ul><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592720/extras/Polaroid.png?t=1702054809"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
