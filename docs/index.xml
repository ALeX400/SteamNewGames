<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

Develop your early small settlement into a city bustling with life and dripping with gold. Build, develop, manage your resources and appease the Gods. Dominate other newly rising or existing settlements of other families through conquest or peaceful talks. Diplomacy or blood… it is your choice.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_1-Build_the_mightiest_and_most_expansive_empire_of_Yucatan.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Become the architect of your mythical city</strong></h2>As the Leader, you will be responsible for every building built on your territory, such as sawmills, temples, housing, barracks and many more. Skillfully plan your city as every path may play a vital role in managing your city. Well-planned zones of your empire will have a special impact on the proper and quickly develop your city. The fate of the citizens depends on you.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_2-Become_the_architect_of_your_mythical_city.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gather resources</strong></h2>There are many resources on your territory crucial for the development, conquest and keeping your empire stable. Some will be used for daily life, other resources will have a chance to become part of a variety of weapons – so vital to plan your skirmishes.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_3-Gather_resources.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Offer sacrifices to the Gods to earn their favor…</strong></h2>Without sacrifices, there is no game based on a mythical ancient tribe, right? God's favor is one of the basic and important quests in the game. Thanks to their approval your city will not only develop freely but also expand its borders and acquire greater military and political capabilities. Satisfy your Gods to avoid their wrath. You can make sacrifices through your Priest in places of worship such as temples. Choose an appropriate slave, organize a grand festival in honor of the chosen Deity and perform secret dark rituals to the delight of the audience. In return, you can expect divine protection from different cataclysms or an increase in yields from your farms and fields.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_4-Offer_sacrifices_to_the_Gods_to_earn_their_favor….gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>… or prepare for their wrath</strong></h2>Gold, riches, extraordinary development… it can’t be that easy. Each repeating or grand one-time festival requires sacrifices. If you happen to forget about worship, the Deities will send many cataclysms to your empire or other problems that will hinder your development. Some will be more or less taxing, but it is always better to evade a lone lightning bolt striking your home and setting the city ablaze or a huge tornado wreaking havoc in your city. Plan well what and when you offer your Gods as no mortal has survived their wrath.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_5-…_or_prepare_for_their_wrath.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Conquer and enslave neighboring people</strong></h2>Every gold is paid for in blood and war is the easiest way to get rich fast. Plunder resources, earn slaves and conquer new land needed for development. Gods are not the only worry, there are other peoples and tribes aiming for the same goal as you. Organize military expeditions, and reinforce the war front or defense lines with resources, which will help in your skirmishes with the enemy. Skillful resource management during war will have an impact on whether your people will come back as victorious conquerors bearing gifts or losers. Fight for the title of the mightiest ruler of the Golden City, El Dorado!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-Last.png?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Do not lose yourself in pride.</strong></h2> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F7hSuXNCpMP" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/Discord_button_update.png?t=1706789517"/></a><br/><br/>The First Journey is just the beginning of a much grander experience (as the name sort of implies!). So, for now, familiarize yourself with the wasteland - you'll spend a lot more time in it when Outcast Tales is out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Be tactical</strong> (or mash buttons;  might work just as well)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Intro.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Robots, mutants, desert raiders: almost all enemies have something up their sleeve. So do your characters: some abilities are most effective in combination with others. Find your opponents' weaknesses, humiliate them on the battlefield, and never ponder the moral implications of your actions!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Use your strengths</strong> (if you can find any)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Personas.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Combine class and personality types to give each of your characters a unique set of abilities. A Preacher Mercenary and an Antihero Mercenary will behave quite differently. Create a balanced crew, or just try out the wildest combinations to see how they turn out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Overcome challenges</strong> (or mess everything up)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Events.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Your characters will encounter dozens of unique situations that test their skill and wits. The Pacifist might talk his way out of trouble, the Egghead might try setting up traps, and the Daredevil will most likely just start blasting! In Outcast Tales, there are no wrong answers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Develop relationships</strong> (like in a dating game, but not quite)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Relations.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Your characters can develop deep bonds or even fall in love - but can also come to despise each other, all depending on your actions. Your journey can become a wholesome story about newfound friendship, or a gruesome tale of three strangers constantly at each other’s throats. Whatever sounds more fun…<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Let the chat join the action</strong> (or, more realistically, set you up)! </h2><br/>Connect the game to your Twitch account so that your viewers can influence the gameplay! The Twitch Integration feature will enable your chat to make crucial decisions during events, as well as choose your next destination or ability upgrade. And don't worry, your viewers won't ever try to harm you. They love you. Right..?						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2511500/Dominions_6__Rise_of_the_Pantokrator/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Your king father is dead, and you are now alone. A day ago he stood strong and proud. The royal advisors found cause and means to open your king father's chest to voice their dissent against his rule. "Trust no one," were his dying words. You do not know why they killed him, or how they killed him, but there is no denying that they succeeded. The mandate of heaven falls to you. You must prolong the <strong>Dynasty</strong>.</i><br/><br/><strong>Dynasty</strong> is a social deduction roguelike in which you must rule your kingdom through your advisors, who you are unsure whether you can trust. Your advisors hold the keys to power. You must please them enough to keep them loyal and grant them the power to administrate your kingdom. But beware-- the more power you grant them, the more they may use that power against you. You must survive 30 turns without being assassinated. If you have not been assassinated by your advisors by turn 30, you win.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Play a social deduction roguelike in which you must avoid assassination by your advisors as you administer your kingdom.<br/></li><li>200 programs<br/></li><li>30 turns<br/></li><li>15 abilities<br/></li><li>6 advisors<br/></li><li>1 monarch</li></ul><br/>There are six primary advisors:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Seneschal Belmin</strong>: The majordomo of your palace. Through him you can curry the loyalty of your other advisors. He can help you expand your palace and staff, and with enough power can learn the true loyalty of your other advisors.<br/></li><li><strong>Captain Niri</strong>: The Captain of your Crownguard. She will help you discover and foil assassination plots. If you suspect another advisor of plotting against you, you can have her arrest them, to be replaced by another hopefully more loyal second.<br/></li><li><strong>Treasurer Chaddik</strong>: Of the Royal Treasury. He safeguards your income and manages your coffers and expenses. Through him you can purchase the loyalty of other advisors.<br/></li><li><strong>Magistrate Elenda</strong>: Of the Ministry of the Commons. She represents the will of your subjects. Without her resourceful solutions to the problems your kingdom faces, there would surely be unrest and revolts.<br/></li><li><strong>Unitary Alesanvi</strong>: The highest religious officiant. The piety of other advisors only offers her more power, though she tells you that her power comes only from the heavens.<br/></li><li><strong>General Higan</strong>: The commander of the Royal Army. Through his military might you can command fear and obedience. Beware that you do not turn your kingdom into a military dictatorship.</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Reality Mixer - Mixed Reality for VR headsets</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1844610/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_VR_headsets/?snr=1_239_new__tab-AllNewReleases</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1844610/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Software</h2>
<i>Reality Mixer</i> lets you bring real objects into VR. It uses the cameras on the headset to show a real object and its surroundings in the current VR environment. It can be used at the same time as other VR software and games.<br/><br/>Think of objects like keyboard &amp; mouse, a racing wheel, HOTAS, a clock on the wall, a drink on your desk, a phone, a tablet, a chair, etc. Also larger real objects can be used. Like the door to your room, so you can see who comes in, or the couch with your friends.<br/><br/>Bringing real objects into a virtual environment is known as '<i>Augmented Virtuality</i>'.<br/><i>Reality Mixer</i> creates 'boxes of reality' which are shown in VR. <br/>Apart from these 'camera boxes' the app also provides a mixed reality <strong><i>Cockpit</i></strong> for use with simracing and flight simulators, a <strong><i>Floor Viewer</i></strong> to quickly see the real floor around your feet and a <strong><i>Lap Viewer</i></strong> for use with seated experiences such as Big Screen. <i>Lap Viewer</i> can be used for quick glances at a normal (untracked) keyboard on your lap.<br/><br/>If you have a Vive or Tundra Tracker, you can attach a camera box to it so the tracked object will be visible wherever it is in your play area.<br/><br/>The real objects (and their immediate surroundings) don't have to be visible all the time. There are three activation methods:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Activate by <strong>Proximity</strong>: Objects (camera boxes) will fade out when you are too far away. This fade out distance can be set by yourself.<br/></li><li>Activate by <strong>Gaze Angle</strong>: Look straight at a camera box to make it visible. Use this activation method with seated games where you have things on a table next to your seat. The activation angle and optional activation delay can be configured. Using an activation delay means you have to look at the object for a second before it starts to show itself, to prevent accidental activation. <i>Floor Viewer</i> and <i>Lap Viewer</i> both use Gaze Angle Activation by default, but can also use Proximity or ButtonPress activation.<br/></li><li>Activate by <strong>Button Press</strong>: Press a keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS or racing wheel button to turn on/off a camera box.</li></ul>When an object is not visible, it will not use any resources.<br/><br/>If you have an <i>Elgato Stream Deck</i>, or if you use <i>Touch Portal</i> on your phone or tablet, you can use it in VR with <i>Reality Mixer</i>.<br/><br/>Chroma keying (green screen) makes the background of the objects transparent so the VR world shows through. This can be useful for objects such as a racing wheel and HOTAS.<h2 class="bb_tag">Instructions</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Start the app once from your Steam Library. It will auto-launch with SteamVR next time.<br/></li><li>Open the SteamVR dashboard.<br/></li><li>Click the icon for the <i>Reality Mixer</i> app. See image below.<br/></li><li>Follow instructions on screen.<br/></li><li>If you use it on a Quest, Pico or Vive XR Elite, you need to turn on <i>passthrough</i> in the <i>Virtual Desktop</i> app on your Quest/Pico/Vive XRE.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Compatibility</h2><i>Reality Mixer</i> is currently compatible with the VR headsets listed here.<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Valve Index<br/></li><li>Meta Quest 2 and 3, when used in combination with the <i>Virtual Desktop</i> app on the Quest<br/></li><li>HP G2 (v1 and v2)<br/></li><li>all first generation Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) headsets<br/></li><li>HTC Vive (the original Vive)<br/></li><li>HTC Vive Pro (version 1 and 2)<br/></li><li>HTC Vive XR Elite, when used in combination with the <i>Virtual Desktop</i> app on the XR Elite<br/></li><li>Pico 4, when used in combination with the <i>Virtual Desktop</i> app on the Pico 4</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Extra features in development</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>External (USB) camera support<br/></li><li>ChromaKey updates<br/></li><li>Extra activation options<br/></li><li>Circular passthrough shape</li></ul>If you want to keep an eye on new features, switch to the beta branch of the app in your Steam Library.
