Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705968827"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

The map mode will help you with this, where you can get all the information about the current task.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_char.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ Earn experience and develop your character’s skills. Useful skills will help you strengthen your squad with more warriors, use artillery, and find more gold and hearts.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_buy_gld.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ The main resource in the game is gold. For gold coins in the conquistador camp, you can hire volunteers, buy food and supplies, and learn some useful skill. The Aztecs did not understand the value of this metal.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_buy_hrt.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ The Aztec blood gods demanded human sacrifices. Therefore, hearts will be useful to you for trading with Indian tribes. In addition, hearts will help restore the health of your warriors on the battlefield.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_sklt_battle.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ Battles with enemies take place in a separate location. Before the battle begins, you have to arrange your warriors in such a way as to protect the flag. During the battle, you will be able to send your warriors to attack or return them to their original positions. You cannot control the actions of a specific warrior.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_units.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ Each fighter in your squad has unique characteristics - spearmen do not allow the enemy to get closer, shooters use arquebuses and crossbows. Field fortifications slow down the enemy's advance, and fighting dogs can frighten any enemy.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_lvl_aztec.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ Using the “Friend of the Indians” skill, you can recruit warlike natives to your squad. And the "Death Whistle" will allow you to resurrect skeletons before each battle.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

The players are controlled by the perfect AI and are thus incredibly smart. They will find any shortcuts and loopholes in the dungeon design.

Twenty character classes are ready to beat the designed dungeons, each with unique movement and abilities.<br/><br/><strong>Perfect AI:</strong> Players who try to beat the dungeons are controlled by the perfect AI. They will find any shortcut or loophole in dungeon design. This makes optimizing dungeon layout very tricky and results in mind-bending designs.<br/><br/><strong>Hand-crafted puzzles:</strong> The game has more than 100 hand-crafted levels designed to produce tricky and complex optimal dungeon layouts from simple movement rules. Every level introduces a new and interesting combination of characters and obstacles that the player has to utilize to slow down the AI.<br/><br/><strong>Steam Workshop:</strong> Make your own levels in an easy-to-use level editor and share them via Steam Workshop.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Game Description</h2><br/><strong>"Avoid the mines, find all the treasures, and clear the stage!"</strong><br/><br/>The primary goal of traditional minesweeper is to locate all the mines on the stage.<br/>This involves distinguishing tiles with mines from those without, and game completion is achieved upon identifying all mine locations.<br/><br/>However, this game's objective is not to find mines.<br/>It's about avoiding mines to discover treasures, and the game is cleared when all treasures are found.<br/><br/>Even if you can discern which tiles are not empty, you cannot know whether they are treasure tiles or mine tiles.<br/><br/>Therefore, you can:<br/><br/>Use items to identify the nature of a tile, or<br/>Deduce from the surrounding numbers of mines and treasures, or<br/>Guess based on the current number of remaining mines and traps, or<br/>Just take a wild guess,<br/>to determine whether a tile is a treasure or a mine.<h2 class="bb_tag">A large-scale tomb raiding game mode with multiple stages forming one dungeon</h2><br/>In each stage, finding all treasures lets you acquire one piece of equipment.<br/>With each piece of equipment aiding in clearing stages, complete all stages to find the final treasure and clear the dungeon!<h2 class="bb_tag">A small-scale tomb raiding game mode focusing on clearing a single stage</h2><br/>This game mode involves solving a single stage using deduction alone.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controller Support</h2>No device other than a mouse is needed to play the game!

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH2020-is-back.jpg?t=1705964767"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_NEW_Marketing_images_616.jpg?t=1705964767"><br/><br/>BeachHead is not just a game, it's an immersive journey into a parallel universe where abandoned weaponry shapes the struggle for dominance. Led by the formidable Musso-Khan, the Death Army vies for control, symbolizing a broader contest between autocracy and freedom. Developed by Pepe Moreno, the original creator of the iconic BH2000 series, this revitalized BeachHead offers a full VR experience and living world. Dive into a rich economy, earn BHC credits, and seamlessly trade in the fully integrated BH Marketplace. With enhanced graphics, realistic battles, and a revamped interface, BeachHead delivers a thrilling and strategic gaming experience. Your legacy awaits in this new era of BeachHead!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH2020-city-fullframe.gif?t=1705964767"><br/><br/>Hello, I'm Pepe Moreno, the original creator of the BH2000 series. Digital Fusion Inc., my development company, brought you the hugely successful BH2K game series on both PCs and in arcades worldwide. With a background in comics and a natural inclination for storytelling, I embarked on the journey of crafting BeachHead, originally conceived as a world. However, during that era, the simplicity of games and the constraints of arcade technology limited its potential.<br/><br/>The new iteration of BeachHead has transcended those limitations. It's not just a one-shot deal; it's a fully immersive VR game and a living experience within an expansive, ever-growing game world. This world exists in a parallel dimension to our own, complete with a social structure and economy—essentially, an RPG-like turret defense shooter. While our initial plan during the early access period was to develop the full game and its features, including the vast scope of the BeachHead world, including BH City, we decided to embrace a progressive implementation approach toward achieving the complete BeachHead World experience—one battle at a time. We believe this approach will allow us to gradually unveil the richness and depth of the BeachHead universe, ensuring a captivating and thoroughly developed gaming experience for our players.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAME MODES</h2><br/><strong>BH Battles</strong><br/><br/>Beachhead Battles aims to bring new environments and scenarios to the world of BeachHead. Every battle is unique and will feature new defense positions and weapon turrets to defend against smarter and progressively more difficult new enemy troops and weapons. You’ll never know what’s coming so look for the unlockable assets to help you with the upcoming and unpredictable challenges.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_Battles.jpg?t=1705964767"><br/><br/><strong>BH Rogue</strong><br/><br/>Get ready for an entirely new gaming experience with "BeachHead Rogue." BH Rogue Like game introduces infinite variations while staying true to the original dynamic. Emphasizing player experience (XP), attribute cards, and a dynamic assets marketplace, "BeachHead Rogue" takes the gameplay to a whole new level of excitement and fluidity. Prepare for an adventure like never before!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_Rogue.jpg?t=1705964767"><br/><br/><strong>BH Arcade Classic</strong><br/><br/>BH Arcade Classic retains the traditional BH2K game format but introduces the option of limited or unlimited ammunition choice. Welcome to the new arcade version of Beachhead—the classic game that captivated thousands in arcades worldwide. Experience the thrill of fast-paced, continuous action with short-level pauses and unlimited ammunition. Engage in the Beachhead arcade leaderboard competition, designed for quick and enjoyable play, whether you're competing for the top spot or just having fun.

Keep playing until you can no longer hold on, aiming for the highest score. Ready for the challenge? Take it on and push yourself to see how far you can go!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_Survival.jpg?t=1705964767"><br/><br/><strong>BH Level editor</strong>(upcoming updates)<br/><br/>This feature is more than a plus, as it opens the door for users to design their battles and levels, not just to challenge themselves but to challenge others and have others challenge them in return. The level editor interface is very graphical and quite easy to use, and you can test the levels and battles as you program them. The idea is that users will be able to publish their battles for others to play and vice versa and for the battles to be rated to be included into the official game.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_Editor_screen.jpg?t=1705964767"><h2 class="bb_tag">MAIN FEATURES</h2><br/>BH Graphics<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong>: Significant improvements in graphics and lighting create a more immersive and true-to-life experience.

Before that, BEACHHEAD shook up the PC world gaming establishment by being one of the first to introduce the concept of quick easy to play, arcade-style games into the early computer market, becoming one of the most internationally recognizable titles of all times. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH2002-covercrop.gif?t=1705964767"><br/><br/>BeachHead is a legendary game with the most incredible saga of addictive gameplay and international success.

BeachHead became the number one top-earning game in the U.S. and many other countries around the world. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH-vortek.gif?t=1705964767"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1288790/extras/BH_Arcade-patch-2.jpg?t=1705964767"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Survive in the skies of Venus with your floating colony as you balance buoyancy, mass, and altitude. Launch balloons and probes to explore the planet while harvesting resources from the atmosphere. Build up your colony and thrive in a simulation based on real science. Venus awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2196190/extras/lightning.gif?t=1705946719"><h2 class="bb_tag">It began as a research station, but it became so much more…</h2><h2 class="bb_tag"></h2><br/><strong>Sky Base Venus</strong> is a colony simulation set in the upper atmosphere of Venus. You have been sent to manage a floating research station there, but political turmoil will soon cause your support from Earth to diminish over time. While still pursuing your original research mission, you will need to make self-sufficiency a priority if you want to survive in the long term.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2196190/extras/build-your-colony-2.gif?t=1705946719"><br/><br/>Fortunately for you, your station is designed to be able to harvest and process resources from Venus’s atmosphere, which you can use to satisfy your colony’s needs and even to manufacture needed goods.  But providing for yourself won’t be the only challenge. Disasters, defects in your equipment, and changing priorities on the part of your Earth-based sponsors will all require you to adapt.<br/><br/>But if you can handle all of these problems, you may even be able to grow your colony, expand your operations, and make this station into more than anyone thought it would be.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2196190/extras/plants-growing-535x301.gif?t=1705946719"><h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Based upon real-life science</strong> – Gameplay draws upon real-life research that suggests a floating crewed station at altitudes from 50-61km is feasible.<br/></li><li><strong>In-Situ Resource Utilization</strong> – Gather materials from Venus’s atmosphere and process them in order to provide your colony with things from oxygen and water to plastic products.<br/></li><li><strong>Budget Resources Wisely</strong> – Buy new machines to harvest resources, or buy the resources themselves.  Pursue research projects that require lots of resources but give significant rewards, or economize and stick with cheaper projects that yield less.  And be especially careful with resources that have to be shipped from Earth – at great cost.<br/></li><li><strong>Randomized Research</strong> – The research projects available to you are randomized, and their feasibility, time, and cost may vary from one playthrough to another.  You also won’t always know the time or cost of these projects at their outset – you’ll have to balance the risk involved versus the potential reward.<br/></li><li><strong>Disasters and Design Defects </strong>– Your colony may face serious accidents.  But even worse, your colony’s systems may have randomly-determined design defects that are unknown at the start of the game and whose effects may last.  Each playthrough will bring different challenges.<br/></li><li><strong>Altitude Matters</strong> – Should you float higher to get more solar energy, or float lower to be able to carry more weight?  It’s up to you.<br/></li><li><strong>Space Logistics</strong> – You can order new equipment and goods from Earth, but these things can only be shipped during realistic transfer windows, and can take over a hundred Earth days to arrive.  You’ll need to plan your shipments carefully to avoid shortages.</li></ul><br/>Wishlist and follow now!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2196190/extras/building-animation-video-2a.gif?t=1705946719"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
