      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the BAORA9 production facility! Your goal is to <strong>collect items</strong> extracted from the facility and deliver them to <strong>reach the required quota</strong> for leaving the structure. Beware of the "local creatures," <strong>monsters that will raid the facility</strong> through the ventilation ducts during your work sessions. Each level features a different creature, <strong>each requiring a unique approach to survive</strong>. Use a <strong>limited battery scanner</strong> to detect monsters, managing it wisely to avoid being defenseless.<br/><br/>The facility is divided into three rings. You can close the doors of various zones to protect yourself and block local creatures during the game. Keep track of the number of managed zones, as losing too many will slow down item production, making it harder to reach the quota to abandon the structure.<br/><br/>Your survival depends on your intuition, wit, and skills. Can you find the right strategy, manage resources intelligently, and leave the BAORA9 production facility unscathed?						</div></div>]]></description>

She has a prestigious job, she just got her own house, and the fellowship pays her a monthly stipend... Or it did, before it kicked her out for failing her annual review. Alice's only means of getting reinstated is to complete one of the quests she's been given.<br/><br/>With multiple main quests to choose from, it's up to you how Alice goes about getting her job back!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_2_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/>Each of the main quests issued by the Alchemists' Fellowship involves different methods of playing the game. Will you brave the dungeon area and all of its turn-based RPG action to bring the fellowship proof of your prowess? Will you elect to go the farming route and grow mythical crops in your garden? Will you gather the resources you need to expand your home beyond what contemporary craftsmanship allows? Or will you spend your time fishing for a legendary lunker?<br/><br/>No two routes play exactly the same, and you can take on whichever you want—or even all of them at once—while also completing optional quests for a variety of townsfolk.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_3_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_01_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_02_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2657720/extras/Alchemist_Quest_Description_4_EN.png?t=1706333872"><br/><strong>Multiple Ways to Play</strong><br/>No two main quests play the same.

Each one has her own unique talents, so you can enjoy building a party of two that suits your combat style!<br/><br/><strong>Pacifist Routes</strong><br/>Several of the game's main quests focus on different kinds of gathering, and thus can be completed without ever seeing a battle screen.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							▲ Combat!<br>
Removing zombies one by one with silenced firearms and close-in weapons will allow you to explore safely most of the time, but you will still inevitably encounter a wave of zombies roaming the streets, so don't let your guard down. If you have enough ammunition, try to use a heavy gun to clean up the enemy!<br>
Don't trust any survivors like you who came from other survivor camps to loot the city. They're more interested in ripping supplies off your hands than they are in a time-consuming search of the city, and humans are much scarier than zombies.<br>
▲ Death!<br>
Once your character dies, you lose all the equipment and supplies you carry, so survival is the key to this game. When your character is killed, you might want to try your luck with scavengers team, who are experts in salvaging lost objects.<br>
▲ Dark!<br>
Face the endless night of the zombie crisis, then feel your way through the darkness. But in the face of other survivors, night may be your weapon.<br>
▲ Refit!<br/>
With more than 60 weapons and nearly 200 modified accessories, modify the strongest and most reliable weapons you like to shoot zombies!<br/>
▲ Manage!<br/>
Irregular item size backpack system. There's always a lot of trash to pick up, so manage your backpack, ditch the worthless goods, and leave with what's really useful.<br/>
▲ Explore!<br/>
Go to different city scenes and explore different buildings. Be careful with your ammo and supplies, and plan your escape time, once your ammo runs out you will not be able to leave the city alive.<br/>
▲ Camp!<br/>
While in camp, you'll be safe, interacting with different NPCS, managing warehouses, selling or buying supplies and equipment, or trading treasured supplies for rare items, and of course, you'll be able to talk to an instructor about training programs to improve yourself.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Brief</h2>Octameta is a distinctive 3D puzzle game that immerses players in an enduring exploration of the enigmas of human science.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>In a world where human civilization has collapsed, you will take on the role of an intelligent being, reconstructing and comprehending the evolution of human technology by solving a symbolic two-layered Rubik's Cube composed of technological fragments. The main focus of the gameplay lies in deciphering the Rubik's Cube, while the secondary aspect involves solving puzzles in small-scale scenarios.<h2 class="bb_tag">Levels</h2>We have four civilization fragments to restore. Restoring the Rubik's Cube at each stage involves an in-depth exploration of scientific principles, such as polar coordinates (representing reproduction), Newtonian gravity (representing money), circuit theory (representing religion), and Fourier transform (representing power). Those principles not only embody the scientific progress of human history, but also reflect fundamental issues of human society.<h2 class="bb_tag">Epilogue</h2>Every significant advancement in the field of natural science made by humanity serves as a means of reinforcing the social structure. Despite originating from pure curiosity, it invariably veers off course due to the powerful inertia of the social system.<br/>This phenomenon recurs at every stage of human social evolution: from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalist private ownership. Mathematics is utilized for taxation, while the information exchange facilitated by the internet progressively erects firewalls and censorship.
