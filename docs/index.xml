<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Build your settlement and satisfy the needs of your penguins with better food, elegant decorations, entertainment venues, high-tech coolers, and luxury houses while dealing with killer whales and thief seals.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/GeneralView5.gif?t=1709984701"><h2 class="bb_tag">Design your penguin settlement</h2>Shape a settlement worthy of your penguins. Set up new energy generators to activate more houses, workplaces, and coolers. Build workplaces to produce materials, food, and medicine.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/SnowBlock2.gif?t=1709984701"><h2 class="bb_tag">Protect your settlement</h2>Build defense towers against killer whales and thief seals. Killer whales attack your buildings and try to destroy them. Seals come to the food storages to steal food.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/KillerWhale01.gif?t=1709984701"><h2 class="bb_tag">Happy and educated penguins</h2>Build some entertainment venues and let your penguins enjoy skating in the ice rinks, watching films at cinemas, playing video games in the game centers, racing in the karting tracks, exercising at gyms and in the fight clubs, visiting the museums, doing yoga, etc. Don't forget to focus on the spirituality of your penguins and increase their happiness with shrines and wishing wells. Focus on education and provide enough seats for your penguins at schools, high schools, and libraries. Make a huddle-up call to gather all your penguins and celebrate together.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/FightClub2.gif?t=1709984701"><h2 class="bb_tag">Focus on economy</h2>Please be careful with spending your gold and focus on finding ways to earn more. Purchase or make barter to reach rare resources, sell your products to increase wealth, and grow your settlement. If you become the king, you can use continuous trades with the help of your bazaars.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/Storage.gif?t=1709984701"><h2 class="bb_tag">Become the King</h2>Reputation score is the overall evaluation of your settlement in the kingdom. Meet the requirements, improve your reputation, and cheer up your penguins to level up from a village to a king. Become the king to explore new lands, find new settlements, and decide their joining approval to the kingdom.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2635350/extras/Huddle3.gif?t=1709984701"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/GreenDragon.gif?t=1709885067"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTER</strong></h2><br/><br/>Stolen Realm is a <strong>simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements</strong> where you control up to <strong>6 heroes, solo or through online co-op</strong>, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. <br/><br/>Stolen Realm features an <strong>innovative turn-based combat system</strong> where <strong>simultaneous turns</strong> allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!<br/> <br/>With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&amp;D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  <br/><br/>Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> – or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!<br/><br/>Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!<br/><br/>Carve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield. <strong>Recover the Stolen Realm.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/CycloneKick.gif?t=1709885067"><h2 class="bb_tag">PRAISE FOR STOLEN REALM</h2><br/>“The tactical depth of Divinity: Original Sin” - GamesRadar+<br/><br/>“we’re losing our evenings to… Stolen Realm” - TheXboxHub<br/><br/>“A gorgeous looking game” - PC Gamer<br/><br/>“You can be a fire warrior.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>

You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away.

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Thaumaturge_accolade_616x320_steam.png?t=1709742147"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/TT_claim_EN_small.png?t=1709742147"><br/><strong>The Thaumaturge is an isometric, story-rich RPG with a unique take on turn-based combat, character development features, and investigation mechanics</strong>, facing you with morally ambiguous choices – set in a world teeming with mysterious powers and strange ethereal beings called <strong>salutors</strong>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/City_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>The year is 1905. Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Buka_2.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>A <strong>thaumaturge</strong> bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for <strong>Wiktor Szulski</strong>, the game’s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktor’s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as <strong>salutors</strong> - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Wiktor_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Shape your story</strong> – as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. <br/></li><li><strong>Develop your character</strong> – creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. <br/></li><li><strong>Experience unique turn-based combat</strong> and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.<br/></li><li><strong>Influence and manipulate</strong> the temperaments of other characters to bend their will to your liking. <br/></li><li><strong>Tame the power of salutors</strong> – use the unique set of their skills to gain an advantage while exploring the world and when bringing your adversaries to their knees. <br/></li><li><strong>See the world that’s inevitably gone</strong> – explore the uncommon, heavily researched historic period of the early XX century Warsaw, where crime and luxury are often two sides of the same coin. Meet historical figures and learn about their involvement in the story. <br/></li><li><strong>Created in Unreal Engine 5</strong> to deliver a detailed &amp; beautifully crafted world.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_HEADER.png?t=1708958635"><br/><br/><strong>DESCEND INTO THE UNDERWORLD OF JAPANESE STREET RACING</strong><br/><br/>Set in an unknown time between 1990-2009, you will navigate through the corrupt and shady power struggles of local street racing crews, all competing for control of their regions and to top the crew rankings.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Extremely detailed customization, including Exterior, Interior, Wheels, Engine, and Handling</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Dynamic character dialogue; other racers will comment on your car, your recent races, new local records and your progression</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Full Photomode with VHS, old camera effects and motion blur</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Freely walk around your garage and the car meet (Parking Area) between races</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Adjustable screenshake and camera FOV</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Procedural game event scripting, high replay value</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_2.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Inspired by the real life Japanese used car auctions, you will purchase your first vehicle by visiting the used car auctions and leaving with any decrepit car you can afford.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_3.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Walk around your safehouse and view all your hard-earned cars; change their oil, repair their engines and view their stats. Good maintenance will help your engine last longer after a long night of abuse and overheating.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_4.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Take parts off your cars, place them into storage and sell them for some extra cash or transfer them onto another vehicle you own. When you have some spare cash, take a trip to "Top Garage" to buy some new parts for your exterior, interior, wheels, engine and/or handling.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_1.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Progress through the underworld by entering a "PA"(Parking Area) and start negotiating wagers with any local crew members who care to race you. You are free to walk around any "PA" and bask in the thick atmosphere of smog and secondhand cigarette smoke.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_5.png?t=1708958635"><br/>The local racers are not impressed with newcomers and will make their disdain known. Impress them by winning and they will change their tone.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_6.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Earn cash by beating racers in 1vs1 wagers but be warned; these are real wagers and you will lose the money you bet if you lose the race! Some racers will take pity on you and give you a chance to win your money back by suggesting a 'double or nothing' race. It's your choice if you want to take that risk.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion.<br/><br/>Take control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps. Make decisions about unit placement, battle tactics and abilities so that you don’t just survive but can become the leader of the resistance against the machines. Hone your skills and military expertise by replaying and achieving the best possible outcomes.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Dynamic battlefields: realistic tactics and consequences</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif2.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>Engage in complex, realistic battles where your <strong>tactical decisions</strong> are vital to your survival and ultimate victory. Use a variety of military equipment, vehicles and ammunition types in your battles against the enemy. Recruit and train new units, assign new skills and acquire new weapons and equipment to continue the resistance.<br/><br/>Encounter tense battles. Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Lead the survival of mankind</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif3.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>Recruit others to your cause and <strong>grow your army</strong>.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/gif-1.gif?t=1710040081"><br/><br/>Discover the world of the future with Avium, a role-playing adventure game where you can enjoy an open world, deep story, and future technology. Test new generation weapons, investigate complex crimes, explore the city and its inhabitants. And defeat your enemies, who are trying to destroy peace and order.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/title-0.png?t=1710040081"><br/><br/>Gary, Jake, Derek, and Sarah together make up the Vanguards Vigilante Group in Avium, a desert city that thrives on the edge of Cyberpunk style. They're doing their best to keep the peace and uphold the law, but growing animosity against all vigilantes has reached its peak. <br/><br/>While exposing corruption in Avium's various districts alongside hunting down your nemesis, the sentient robot menace known as Haz-Mat, you'll get to fly and fight as the vigilante Jake aka "Diezel". You will have to uncover many mysteries and secrets of this world, find yourself on the brink of death and challenge new vices and problems of the future world in an age where emotional instability, political nepotism, and social upheaval dominate logic. The race toward the next stage in human evolution begins. In the aftermath of democracy and rise of totalitarianism, we have colonized the Solar System, making our once estranged planets part of our new empire. Cutting edge cybernetics, super power drugs, the loss of thousands of years of history, and the power vacuum between rivaling corporations all plunge Avium, the cyber capital of Earth, into revolt.<br/><br/>However, a far greater force of darkness looms on the horizon, threatening to end humanity's reign across all dimensions, all times, and all stages of evolution...<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/gif-2.gif?t=1710040081"><br/><br/><strong>Campaign Length</strong>: 3hrs.<br/><strong>Free Mode</strong>: Choose one of three Open World Areas, independent from the story of Avium.<br/><strong>Arcade Mode</strong>: Tutorials, Boss battles, Elimination battles, Zombies, and a race to play.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/title-1.png?t=1710040081"><br/><br/>1) <strong>"A single button can save the universe"</strong> - Avium sets you up to pay attention to the world and your pop-in messages to understand the world of Avium, what to do, and when to do it. Hints, collectibles, Easter eggs, tricks, clues, lore, abilities, and details are at your disposal. Reading between the lines in what you're given leads you to understand Avium and of what it's trying to warn you. Don't take anything at face value. Nothing is free. 'Interacting' at certain points during certain two important cutscenes give you the edge or save the universe altogether...<br/><br/>2) <strong>"Accessible Lore, if you want it. Deep world, if you don't"</strong> - You have access to as much lore as you'd find in a book through the use of pop-in tutorial messages, lore in-world, and NPC dialogues. But a majority of your arsenal/abilities, allies' motivations, and world order are not directly given to you, but instead are revealed only to the most curious. Explore &amp; investigate, and you will find the truth! Or don't...<br/><br/>3) <strong>"No single weapon is the best in the game"</strong> - Avium is also designed to give you immense choice in how you fight enemies. While Enemies and Bosses are not overly complex, every weapon affects common enemies and bosses differently. Choose your weapons wisely to defeat the enemies. Watch those pop-ins.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/gif-3.gif?t=1710040081"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/title-2.png?t=1710040081"><br/><br/><i>"Avium is a snapshot of our society today, but 100 years from now. <br/>Our incredible ability to adapt, left unchecked, has the potential to be our downfall. We are creatures of evolution. On one hand, it gave us marvels of medicine and technology, life-extending wonders! On the other hand, it has changed our sense of definition. <br/><br/>As we progress, we're leaving behind history, tradition, and religion--a by-product of progress. We're naturally and unintentionally replacing all of the past with this die-hard pursuit of truth, spectacle, or convenience, or sometimes all three. This is the natural course of adaptation. Taking this to its extreme means that anything we "know" today can't possibly stand the test of time as a concrete definition. Everything we "know" is subject to redefinition because of some discovery in our near future. Rules and laws become adapted. Constitutions and democracies become adapted. <br/><br/>There will come a point in time when we can redefine anything to mean anything except what it was originally defined as. This coupled with everyone's avarice to be "right" welcomes widespread disconnect that pits everyone's definitions against everyone else's on Earth. So instead of there being one definition, there are 8 billion, 10 billion, fifteen billion definitions. And you have just as many perspectives, justifications, and personal rights that bolster those opinions and a growing irrational determination to shut down any opposing view because these views you've defended are now part of your identity, your livelihood--adapted to each individual. And because these anecdotal "truths" are so personal and irrefutable to you, you can make anything you say as authentic as you want it to be perceived. <br/><br/>Our adaptation taken to its ultimate conclusion spells the eventual breakdown in our psychology, our biology, our history. If nothing can matter more than one's own personal freedoms and personal rights and personal truths, all of which you've gone to such great lengths to redefine as "objective truths" in a world where proof can no longer be obtained by a majority without shattering our concept of our self-indulgent reality, then what is reality? <br/><br/>As you're sailing through the endless ocean of "truth", no one can tell you anything. You can do and be anything! And THAT is exactly where the Big Four (Guise, Falcon Industries, GAMMA, and the Right Hand) want us: Stuck in the sensational illusion that we have the freedom of choice when, in fact, we are drowning in the ocean of "freedom", guided only by our desires and pleasures and unified only by our hatred of opposition. It's no wonder 98.6% of the human population now unironically shares the same beliefs, goals, and hatred.<br/><br/>In such a world, Avium lets you get a taste of what could be, lets you witness both the benefits of such a "unified" society and the obvious pitfalls of isolationist self-pursuits.<br/><br/>Evolution isn't a gift, it's a negotiation. <br/><br/>What would you give for it?"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/gif-4.gif?t=1710040081"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622850/extras/title-3.png?t=1710040081"><br/><br/>If you're seeking:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Looter-Shooter</i></strong> elements with <strong><i>Open-world Exploration</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>An arsenal of <strong><i>Missiles-Turrets-and-Flight</i></strong> via your jet-like War-Suit and breakneck speed <strong><i>Combat</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Boss Battles</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Slide, Triple Jump, Dashing, Wall-Dashing</i></strong>, and <strong><i>Superhero Landing</i></strong> Locomotion Features</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Hacking</i></strong> doors with code</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Defensive &amp; Offensive <strong><i>Teleportation</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A <strong><i>Magic System (Ice, Fire, Electricity, Telekinesis)</i></strong> for unlocking puzzles &amp; minor combat</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Laser Vision</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong><i>Stealthy Assassinations</i></strong> &amp; <strong><i>Invisibility</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The ability to seamlessly <strong><i>swap from FPS to TPS</i></strong></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Dystopian capitalism, neon skylines, allegory, tragedy &amp; betrayal...but you also want to dip your toes in the Hard Sciences of the fermi paradox, quantum mechanics &amp; multiverses, general relativity, the Kardashev scale, Bekenstein bound, Planck time, extraterrestrial life, robotics, artificial intelligence, war, black holes, evolution, and did I mention LASERS??</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fun little <strong><i>Easter Eggs</i></strong> and references that pay homage to the games that inspired Avium.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>And <strong><i>Photo Mode</i></strong>!

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2831570/extras/P_Summary.png?t=1709999233"><br/><strong><i>Enemies on camera, enemies off camera!</i></strong><br/><br/>At a performing arts school, Gerald doesn't stand out, so he secretly envies the popular kid, Damian, who Gerald thinks is undeserving of his popularity due to his lack of talent. His insecurity worsens when Damian unintentionally mocks him in front of the entire class. Years after graduation, Gerald becomes a C-list actor who's usually typecast to act in antagonist roles. Meanwhile, Damian becomes a popular heartthrob who's usually the protagonist in romance dramas. Gerald feels bitter that he has to work hard all these years to land auditions, but Damian gets roles automatically handed to him because of his popularity despite his acting being lackluster. His rival's success constantly reminds Gerald of his insecurities and makes him feel like a loser.<br/>One day, Gerald gets the role of the antagonist in a romance drama. By chance, Damian happens to be the male lead in that same drama, and they'll both have to fight over the female lead. Because of his pent-up jealousy and insecurities, Gerald swears to use various underhand tactics on set to embarrass his rival. Damian, on the other hand, is not going to sit back and let himself be provoked. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2831570/extras/P_Characters.png?t=1709999233"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2831570/extras/P_Gerald.png?t=1709999233"><br/>Gerald is aromantic and asexual. Even though his smirk makes him seem like a flirty player, he doesn't like being flirted with. He's not interested in romance, so he's never cared about acting in the romance genre. But for once, he decides to act in one as an antagonist in hopes of getting his name out there. <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2831570/extras/P_Damian.png?t=1709999233"><br/>Despite looking like a typical cute, romantic protagonist, Damian is aloof. He doesn't talk to people off camera unless it's necessary. He only wants to open up to someone who's genuine with him. Since Damian has been the male lead in multiple romance dramas, he'd sometimes flirt and say cheesy lines without intent. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2831570/extras/P_Features.png?t=1709999233"><br/>30K Words (2-3 Hours Playtime)<br/>2 Endings (Neutral Ending &amp; Good Ending)<br/>9 Main CGs + 2 Minor CGs<br/>Original Sound Tracks<br/>Acting Expression Selection Mini-Game						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

He couldn't bring himself to do either, and decided to hide her in his home.<br/><br/>However, this turned out to be much more difficult than he expected. Can he overcome the fear for his own life?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/01.jpg?t=1709971077"><br/>In order to escape the dungeon, the girl unseals the demon. This action is wrong and fatal, she does not get the demon's gratitude, on the contrary, the girl is in extreme danger. Will the poor girl be able to outrun the demon and escape this horrible place alive?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/02.jpg?t=1709971077"><br/>It is a side-scrolling action game. The characteristic of this game is that you need to run as fast as possible. Because if you are too slow, the monster will catch up with you and eat you.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/01.gif?t=1709971077"><br/>Failure doesn't get you down, and you're confident that you'll find a way to cope with it the next time. You will truly feel strong.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/02.gif?t=1709971077"><br/>As a side-scrolling action game, the character will have common abilities such as rolling, continuous jumping, climbing walls, etc. Our protagonist will have none of them missing. And at the beginning of the game, you will have all the abilities, and you won't leave any regrets.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/03.gif?t=1709971077"><br/>The game includes 2 difficulties and 140 levels. There are countless mechanisms and secret paths. Each level is carefully crafted and tested. It won't be too difficult to make you feel helpless, nor too easy to make you bored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2600580/extras/04.gif?t=1709971077"><br/>All in all, I'd say it's a good piece of game. I hope it brings you joy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2565450/extras/about-banner.png?t=1709938254"><br/><br/>Greebles is an action packed game of skill involving bulldozers, cockroaches and fish. Players attempt to navigate a maze of blocks while crushing Greebles to gain points. The more Greebles you crush, the more points you get! Just don't let them touch you!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 100 different levels with unique blocks, greebles, and specials. <br/></li><li> Local PvP or Co-op with up to 4 players.<br/></li><li> Multiplayer matches with up to 36 players.<br/></li><li> 3 difficulty levels.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">How to Play</h2><br/>Push blocks to send them sliding, time it right to scoop up greebles and crush them:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2565450/extras/crush-greeble.gif?t=1709938254"><br/><br/>Push a block that can't move to crush it. Some blocks grant buffs to the player, like speed:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2565450/extras/crush-special.gif?t=1709938254"><br/><br/>Be careful though, different types of blocks behave differently than regular blocks. Grenade blocks explode, pushing adjacent blocks and killing adjacent players or greebles:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2565450/extras/push-grenade.gif?t=1709938254"><br/><br/>Bounce blocks prevent blocks from stopping when they otherwise would, and generator blocks can't be pushed, but periodically spawn new greebles:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2565450/extras/generator-bounce.gif?t=1709938254"><br/><br/>Some generators can be crushed, others can only be destroyed by surrounding them with blocks.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses to the next level when all greebles and greeble generators have been destroyed. <br/><br/>There are many other types of blocks, here are just a few:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Shield - protects you from greebles and sliding blocks.<br/></li><li> Freeze - slows other players, and stops greebles in their tracks.<br/></li><li> Bonus - crush these for extra points.<br/></li><li> Fireball - grants the ability to launch grenade blocks.<br/></li><li> Death Touch - protects you from greebles, and kills anything you touch.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer</h2><br/>While fun to play solo, Greebles becomes much more fun with friends. Up to 4 players can play (PvP or co-op) on a single machine, although it can get a bit crowded around the keyboard! Up to 9 machines (any platform) can connect for LAN play, for a total limit of 36 players per match!<br/><br/><br/>Available natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Greebles intends to be an exact replica of the original game released in 1997. (Produced in collaboration with Stairways Software)						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
