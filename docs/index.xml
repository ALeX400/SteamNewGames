<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/01_risk_of_rain_is_back.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Carefully designed, beautifully remastered, and loaded with new ways to play—Risk of Rain is back and better than ever!

Discover secrets of ancient design lying dormant beneath the surface of Petrichor V. Search under every log, stone, and Gup to find new ways to play!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/04_unlock_notification_popping_up.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/05_Header_Play_solo_or_gather_your_crew.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Many Survivors fled the mysterious attack on your ship. Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Warlords Battlecry: The Protectors of Etheria (or TPE), is a mod for Warlords Battlecry 3 and sequel to the Warlords franchise. TPE is an ambitious project which focuses on a new interactive RPG experience and a streamlined &amp; modernized RTS experience. It is stand-alone, meaning that it can be run without having the original game installed.<br>
<br>
Currently, TPE is in development (and has been since 2010), and has not reached a stable version. However, there are beta versions available for download. All users are considered beta testers and are encouraged to report bugs and make suggestions:<br>
- On the TPE forum<br>
- On the TPE Discord channel<br>
Multiplayer games are also run on the Discord channel.<br>
<br/>
Among various other features, TPE attempts to achieve the following:<br/>
- Provide new RTS and RPG elements which deliver greater strategic and role-playing depth, including greater terrain influences on battles, unit types, dialogue choices, multiple endings and psychological profiles<br/>
- Improve old, poorly designed systems or mechanics, including the resource, combat stat, damage type/armor, hero, retinue, conversion and terrain systems<br/>
- Integrate all official Warlords lore into the game, including lore from: Warlords, Warlords 2, Warlords 3 &amp; its expansion, Warlords Battlecry, Warlords Battlecry 3, Puzzle Quest &amp; its expansions, Puzzle Quest 2, Puzzle Quest 3 and unofficial TPE lore to help fill any gaps (which is based on and respects Warlords lore)<br/>
- Provide new content, including music, maps, productions, heroes, items and a new story-driven, multi-choice campaign with diplomacy, new locations, quests, characters, and videos, which also changes based on hero traits and any of their prior actions or choices<br/>
- Provide the campaigns of the previous Warlords Battlecry games, including the Tears of Dawn WBC1 campaign, the Conquest WBC2 campaign and The Fifth Horseman WBC3 campaign, all updated with TPE’s gameplay<br/>
- Improve pre-existing content, providing new graphics, audio, features and functionality<br/>
- Provide up to 16 player gameplay which can be reliably played in multiplayer<br/>
- High resolution support for up to 4K<br/>
- Improve the editor, increasing the amount of control that map-maker’s have over their designs<br/>
- Fix every single one of the series’ bugs, from the most notorious to the most insubstantial, thereby providing the most reliable and bug-free experience in Warlords Battlecry history<br/>
- In general, bring the game up to modern standards and fulfill the potential of Warlords Battlecry, a founder of the role-playing real time strategy genre						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"To save the one you love, rise again and again. Your unyielding spirit becomes your strongest weapon."<br>
<br>
An Arabian Nights and Ancient Egyptian civilization-themed Soulslike &amp; Roguelite Action game.<br>
<br>
Story:<br>
"In ancient times, a sun-powered priestess brought hope to the people. However, Anubis, the god of the underworld, coveting her radiant power, kidnapped her and imprisoned her in his fortress, the 'Labyrinth of Death.' His aim was to sacrifice the sun priestess to seize the power of the sun god.<br>
<br/>
You, as an assassin sworn to protect the sun priestess, embark on a quest to rescue her from Anubis's stronghold, the 'Labyrinth of Death.' The labyrinth presents various challenges and formidable foes that may defeat you.<br/>
<br/>
However, you possess a unique power—the ability to rewind time with the 'Hourglass of Time.' Even if you fail, you can return to the past and repeatedly face new challenges.<br/>
<br/>
The true enemy in this game is 'giving up.' No matter how many times you fall or fail to defeat your enemies, as long as you don't give up, new challenges await. The true game over only comes when you stop trying. With a burning resolve and belief in your own strength, save the sun priestess and find true love.<br/>
<br/>
Key Features:<br/>
<br/>
Soulslike combat system with robust magic and weapons.<br/>
Random placement of enemies, items, traps, and shops with each attempt.<br/>
Permanent death requiring you to start over upon defeat.<br/>
Dynamic combat utilizing rope actions.<br/>
Strengthen your status, purchase weapons, and items using Spirits gained from defeating enemies.<br/>
Eight levels of dungeons.<br/>
Boss rush mode included.<br/>
*Note: The game does not have a save feature for progress. The deeper you go, the greater the pain of defeat. However, those who have not experienced setbacks are those who never dared to challenge.<br/>
<br/>
As you delve deeper, the tension and suspense increase. Overcome your fear and reach true love.<br/>
<br/>
What's important in life is not to avoid failure but to rise from it, to never give up. Your relentless spirit will become your greatest weapon in overcoming any difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Embark on a journey beyond the realm of the unreasonable."						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Innovative Gameplay</strong><br/>A unique take on CCG games that combines 5vs5 team battles and basketball lore. The result is a short strategically and tactically intensive match that leaves you wanting for more. While your average team battle game needs you to do damage, manage mana and health bars, Dream Team Basketball revolves around scoring points, passing, movement and management of players.<br/><br/>The game has no critical strike chance, but it has 3point shooting that will make your shots score more, there is no armor or evasion but there is stealing and blocking as defense layers. The game embraces well know tactical game systems and brings them to a sports environment format.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2152630/extras/1lineup.jpg?t=1703410527"><br/><br/><strong>Lore Driven Design</strong><br/>Play with over 360 basketball and NBA inspired cards, that allow a multitude of gameplay styles and enable crazy combos. With over 450 players, each with an unique combination for their 3 skills, up to 4 passives and other various traits, the game offers infinite possibilities for the deck building side of the game. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2152630/extras/1pp2.jpg?t=1703410527"><br/><br/><strong>Competitive Environment</strong><br/>Our intention is to develop a competitive scene around the game and have embraced a "easy to learn, hard to master" design philosophy. The starting 5 players will have an important role for the outcome of the game, while the 7 bench players will give players a multitude of option to interact with various strategies when needed. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2152630/extras/1pack.jpg?t=1703410527"><br/><br/>Dream Team Basketball is still in development.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A 2D top-down view, strategy game, with original mechanics. The game consists of 46 levels. Each level takes approximately 30-60 seconds to clear,  but maybe 10 minutes to think or 10 times to try.<br>
You would operate two characters to collect diamonds from mines, one character moves quickly and works slowly, and the other character moves slowly and works quickly. Although each character has different moving control keys, only one character can be moved at one time.<br>
When get diamonds from mining, characters could fetch diamonds of different colors into “little universe” to generate bricks of corresponding color to pave the way to the key.<br>
Each level has strict time limit, and you need to obtain the key within the time limit.<br>
The game describes my understanding of how intelligent species encounter or avoid Great Filter. Extinction or survival.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Visit From Above is a sit-and-survive horror game (inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's) that puts you face to face with aliens. You will have to survive 3 nights using different methods to defeat the aliens including a flashlight, turning power on/off, and closing your eyes (pretend to sleep).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In the quiet town of Crestwood, something sinister lurked beyond the starlit sky. The Stevenson family, comprised of John, a high-ranking military officer, his wife Lisa, a scientist, and their teenage daughter, Mia, lived a seemingly ordinary life in their suburban home.<br>
<br>
One fateful night, as the family settled in for dinner, an unnatural darkness enveloped the neighborhood. The power grid failed, plunging the Stevenson household into an inky blackness. As the family groped for flashlights, a blinding flash illuminated the sky. Unbeknownst to the unsuspecting Earthlings, an alien race with nefarious intentions had set their sights on Crestwood.<br/>
<br/>
From the shadows emerged extraterrestrial beings capable of mimicking any form they encountered. These shape-shifters, driven by a malevolent agenda, had been observing humanity and plotting their infiltration for years. The power outage provided the perfect cover for their invasion.<br/>
<br/>
Silently, the alien doppelgangers assumed the appearance of the Stevenson family, mimicking every detail down to the last freckle. With their disguises in place, they infiltrated the Stevenson home, lurking in the corners like predatory phantoms.<br/>
<br/>
The real Stevenson family, armed with flashlights, cautiously navigated their darkened house. Unease hung in the air as they felt an unnatural chill. Unknown to them, their doppelgangers now sat at the dinner table, their eyes glinting with an otherworldly malevolence.<br/>
<br/>
As the power outage persisted, tensions within the household escalated. The alien clones, adept at replicating human behavior, exploited the confusion and paranoia that gripped the real Stevenson family. Whispers in the dark and eerie laughter echoed through the halls, sowing discord among the unsuspecting inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
The turning point came when John, suspicious of his surroundings, stumbled upon the imposter version of himself. A chilling confrontation unfolded, revealing the true horror that had invaded their home. The alien doppelgangers, no longer able to maintain their facade, shed their human forms, exposing grotesque, otherworldly features.<br/>
<br/>
A desperate struggle ensued as the real Stevenson family fought to protect their home and each other. The alien invaders, relentless and ruthless, revealed their plan to conquer Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The once peaceful Crestwood became a battleground, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.<br/>
<br/>
In Visit From Above, you are put in the shoes of John Stevenson, after the rest of his family has already been overtaken by their alien clones. Your job will be to keep the aliens at bay until the government broadcasts a special audio frequency harmful only to the extraterrestrials.

They have previously solved the mysteries you now have to solve, and left notes about the solutions. With these notes, you can progress more efficiently. Thanks to the left messages, you will also learn about what happened here before you, but you are determined not to trust anyone.<br/><br/><strong>Dynamic Tension and Horror</strong><br/>The dungeon seems to respond to your every move.

This dungeon is ready to tell you all this and more!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707090/extras/3.gif?t=1703358267"><br/><br/><strong>Warnings</strong><br/>The Nefargad includes profanity and slang in its game content. <br/>The Nefargad contains flashing and/or rapidly blinking lights in both game content and promotional materials.
