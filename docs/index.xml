<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"Momodora: Moonlit Farewell" is the latest installment in the Momodora series. Join Momo, High Priestess of the village of Koho, as she embarks on a divine mission to save her people from imminent destruction at the hands of the demon hordes summoned by a malevolent bellringer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell presents the account of the greatest calamity to befall the village of Koho, five years after the events of Momodora III.<br/> Once the toll of an ominous bell is heard, the village is soon threatened by a demon invasion.<br/>The village's matriarch sends Momo Reinol, their most capable priestess, to investigate the bell and find the bellringer responsible for summoning demons. It is their hope that by finding the culprit, they will also  be able to secure the village's safety, and most importantly, the sacred Lun Tree's, a source of life and healing for Koho...<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gorgeous pixel art and animation<br/></li><li> Action-packed gameplay focusing on melee combos, dodging enemy attacks, and firing arrows at enemies<br/></li><li> The "Sigil" system, which allows for greatly customizable play styles<br/></li><li> Intense and core-shaking boss battles<br/></li><li> Deep exploration into a world rich in lore and atmosphere<br/></li><li> Freely adjustable difficulty levels, allowing you to relax and explore the alluring world at your own pace or take on mighty foes for a real challenge</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Developer's Voice:</h2>Hello!<br/><br/>This is rdein, creator of the Momodora series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, “Moonlit Farewell”. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of Momodora 3. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games’ mysteries and questions.<br/><br/>I’m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I’m designing “Moonlit Farewell” to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of Momodora 1 to 3’s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don’t worry too much about “catching up”!<br/>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we’ve learned in the past 10 years. Please look forward to it!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705083406"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705083406"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1794700/extras/warning.png?t=1705068411"><br/><br/>If you're looking for a simple game with easy gameplay, and a forgiving atmosphere, <i>LEAVE THIS GAME PAGE.</i> This isn't that kind of game.<br/><br/>No, you see, <strong>F*ck This Game</strong> is a game that is extremely difficult. The premise may <i>sound</i> simple: use the keys on your keyboard to control small minigames, including a side-scrolling platformer and a shoot-em-up game. But here's the catch: you'll have to control up to 8 of these games <i>at the same time</i>.<br/><br/>You'll earn points for doing certain things, whether it's jumping over an obstacle or catching fruit in a basket. Some of the minigames feature <strong>2x multipliers</strong>, giving you a chance to get an even higher score! But don't hit any obstacles... when you drop to 0 points, you lose!<br/><br/>And let's not forget all the wonderous ways the game will attempt to forcefully deplete your score. Whether it's covering up the minigames, big bugs blocking your view, or even playing random sounds, you'll be constantly barraged with distraction after distraction! Unfair as it may be, do you think you're up to the challenge?<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Arcade-style gameplay<br/></li><li> 8 minigames to play<br/></li><li> Original soundtrack composed entirely by helloitscrash<br/></li><li> Fun instructional art<br/></li><li> Retro graphics and sound effects<br/></li><li> Customizable options, including multiple backgrounds</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">FREQUENTLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Isn't that supposed to be "asked?" Not "answered?"<br/>Yeah. I don't care<br/></li><li> When will the game come out? What's taking so long?<br/>Due to personal reasons the game's been delayed for a <i>pretty</i> long time. But trust me, there's news coming soon<br/></li><li> Is this game really that hard?<br/>Play it for yourself. :)</li></ul> </img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A hidden object game where you must find all the cats and wool to complete each level.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2>🖼️ 15 Unique artworks<br/>❓ 1500+ Hidden objects total<br/>🐈 750+ Cats<br/>🧶 750+ Wool<br/> 💡 ∞ Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br/>♻️ Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br/>🎵 Music for each artwork<br/>⌨️ Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br/>💾 3x save slots<br/>🗑️ Reset progress entirely and play again<br/>🕒 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class="bb_tag">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many cats and wool as they can inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a cat or wool, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class="bb_tag">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.						</div></div>]]></description>

Within its halls, the air was filled with a sense of serenity and camaraderie. Castle Yurei was led by Queen Seraph and her daughter, Princess Tennyo, a wise and compassionate set of angels who embodied strength and grace. In this realm, same-sex love was the only celebrated and embraced love.<br/><br/>However, not far from Castle Yurei, atop a forbidding mountain, loomed the imposing Kingdom Jomon. Within its dark and brooding walls resided a sinister community of demonic same-sex loving men. Led by Prince Akuma, a fearsome and power-hungry figure, their civilization thrives on discord and chaos. Prince Akuma sought to spread his twisted ideology throughout the realm. Prince Akuma has declared war, driven by his hatred for the harmonious existence of Castle Yurei. The angels, determined to protect their sanctuary and their way of life, prepared for battle. Meanwhile, within Castle Jomon, the gay demons assembled under Prince Akuma’s command. With flames flickering in their eyes and fire coursing through their veins, they prepared to unleash their demonic powers upon Castle Yurei. Their mission was to extinguish the light of love, replacing it with blood and chaos.<br/><br/>And so it begins...<br/><br/>...what will you do?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2609540/extras/gif06.gif?t=1705092259"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2609540/extras/footer.png?t=1705092259"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Harness the power of the <strong>Elements</strong> and gather <strong>Spells</strong> to defend yourself against <strong>Hordes of Enemies</strong>!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2556670/extras/Store.png?t=1705044327"><br/><br/>In this game, you are a Wizard, trapped in a castle, as magical creatures are attacking you from every side.<br/>The only way to survive is to fight back with a vast array of different Spells. Spells are cast automatically, however, it's up to you to find the best Combination!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2556670/extras/StoreSpells.png?t=1705044327"><br/><br/><strong>Spell Traits:</strong><br/>It's not only about getting the strongest Spells, it's about finding a Combination, that will grant you even more Power.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2556670/extras/StoreTraits.png?t=1705044327"><br/><br/>Every Spell belongs to one <strong>Element</strong> and one <strong>School</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>Elements</strong> grant <strong>Unique</strong> bonuses to their respective Spells.<br/>Want to <strong>Freeze</strong> your Enemies? <strong>Burn</strong> them to <strong>Ashes</strong>? Or make them <strong>Explode</strong> into <strong>more Projectiles</strong>?<br/>Gather Spells with the same Element to activate these Traits and make them stronger by getting more of the same Element.<br/><br/>Knowing Spells of the same <strong>School</strong> will give you the power of their creators.<br/>Harnessing the power of<strong> Fairies</strong> will give you <strong>regenerative</strong> abilites, or you can become as <strong>strong</strong> as a <strong>Dragon</strong>.<br/>Activating the <strong>Phoenix</strong> School will grow your power <strong>over time</strong> and give  you the ability to <strong>revive</strong>.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The controls of this game are very simple. You can walk and you can jump. Spells and abilities get activated automatically. <br/>You need to survive 20 waves of an onslaught of enemies, that get stronger every wave. Later waves introduce new enemies and there's a big threat in the final wave.<br/><br/>So you walk around casting spells on enemies that will drop loot upon defeat. Gather gems to buy new spells and items to become stronger.<br/>Enemies might occasionally drop an item which you can take or sell at the end of a wave.<br/>Sometimes enemies also drop Heal Orbs, which heal you upon collecting them.<br/><br/>Occasionally Chests will spawn, that you can open by simply touching them. They contain loot, but pay close attention, because not every chest is dormant.<br/><br/>In the shop you can view your current Spells in the top left, where you can also decide to buy new empty Spellbooks. In order to learn a new unique Spell you need at least one empty Spellbook. Buying a Spell that you already have, will add 1 experience point to it. 3 Spells of the same kind will make a level 2 Spell and 9 of a kind make a level 3 Spell, increasing not only the Power, but also giving unique bonuses to certain Spells.<br/><br/>Every Spell has Base Power, Scalings (indicated by the respective Symbol in the Description) and the "Damage" stat acts as a final percentual Modifier for all Player Damage sources. (1 Damage = 101% of original Damage). <br/><br/>In the Shop items can be bought, rerolled or locked (so they reappear next wave). Prices will increase with higher wave numbers.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
