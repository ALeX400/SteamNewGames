<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>"Before the time of the giants, we lived freely under the Sun and Moon. Centuries have passed, but those stories of the surface world have been passed down through the generations. Now the giants are gone, and you, Vanguard, must venture out into the wilds once more, on an urgent mission. Be brave, and do not falter…"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/TreeLookingup.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the vast “Land of the Small" </h2>Traverse lake sized puddles, scale skyscraper sized trees, scramble through cavernous cracks in roads, as you experience a huge open world from a new perspective.

Leap huge distances on the back of a Grasshopper, zoom around on a Damselfly, scurry from place-to-place on a Spider. This world and its inhabitants are yours to conquer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Mounts.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survive together</h2>Play alongside friends with support for up to 10 players in multiplayer.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

Sub-tables are rolled and displayed automatically.<br/><br/>In addition, you are allowed to reroll the whole results, certain results but also even partially reroll certain words until you get exactly what you were looking for.<br/>A vast list of tables awaits you to generate anything you like, and all of them are written by award-winning author Matt Finch and Mythmere games.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>The Notebook &amp; Exports</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2537290/extras/Table_Designer.gif?t=1708354646"><br/><br/>You will be able to use the Adventure Design Tool interactively, generating results from several linked tables all at once. As you work you are allowed to keep results to your “Notebook”.<br/><br/>In the Notebook, you are allowed to further edit your results and when ready you can export in txt or PDF.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Create Your Own Generators</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2537290/extras/send_note.gif?t=1708354646"><br/><br/>The Table Designer Tool lets you create your own generators for anything you can imagine, such as encounter tables, NPCs, and name-generators, but also super complex ones.<br/><br/>We provide you with an easy-to-use tool but if you are familiar with html you can go that way as well.<br/><br/><i>-You can copy-paste from an Excel or CSV.<br/>-You can use any AI Chat to paste results to your tables.<br/>-You can save your Generators and use them later on in your games.<br/>-You can share your generators through Steam Workshop.</i><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>The Tutorial</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2537290/extras/DARK_NEW.gif?t=1708354646"><br/><br/>Although Fantasy Adventure Builder is easy to use, we provide you with a full tutorial video which you can watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ2qf3qaARA&amp;t=3s" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ2qf3qaARA&amp;t=3s</a><br/><br/>Although no code is needed to create your generators and all functionalities work with UI Buttons, we allow you to use HTML and our own pseudo-language as you type.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to this story of regret and death, the world is clumsy, every object is a child's doodle, they are filled with the most simple thoughts, and the mystery of death.<br>
We rush through life, rushing out to appointments, rushing out to errands, rushing out to a long trip, rushing to forget the people in the door. Suddenly one day found that I found that I would never see him again, I ignored all the signs that he was going to leave, ignored the information that life was passing. At this time, my mind just keeps circulating those most regrettable pictures. If we could go back in time, could we find this information and make up for these regrets?<br>
Each regret screen is a level, and you will experience the whole process from ignoring to losing. You will also experience the ability to travel back in time, and I hope you take advantage of this opportunity to make up for some small regrets.<br>
<br>
This game commemorates him in heaven.<br>
<br>
Basic gameplay:<br/>
Time backward-looking secret room decryption game, analyze character dialogue, combine the basic knowledge of the real world, find out the key to decryption, and leave the room. But in any case, each level will have regrettable clues not found, get the ability to go back to each level, find the final way to break the game, make up for each regret.<br/>
1. In each level, the player is in a hurry to leave the room and solve puzzles by clicking on items, moving items, dialog boxes, cutscene ICONS, subtitles, etc.<br/>
2. Analyze the dialogue of the characters to find the way to solve the puzzle. Each level in the game needs to be cleared twice, and the solution of the second time is different from the first time, which requires players to explore by themselves. Attention, please!

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Overview</strong><br/>Following "Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm", "Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward" introduces a new parallel world with new characters and gameplay meticulously optimized for your enjoyment. This game preserves the classic 2D fighting game format and features high-quality pixel graphics and a simple gameplay style that anyone can pick up. <br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>Dec 25th, 1926. The imperial era name transitions to "Kobun” and seems to herald the dawn of a new period in history. <br/><br/>But behind the scenes, a Japanese nationalist revolutionary group has staged a coup d’etat with the goal of restoring "the divine nation of Japan." The revolutionaries acted swiftly, seizing control of the Prime Minister’s residence, the police department, major corporations, and newspapers. <br/><br/>Struggling to react, former government forces initiated a secret plan to eliminate key figures involved in the coup through an assassination program known as "Yatagarasu." This covert opeation was assigned to the "Iga Clan", a ninja clan that exists today as an intelligence agency and who are also known as "Government Dogs."<br/><br/><strong>New Characters</strong><br/>Ugui (VA: Shinobu Matsumoto)<br/>An elderly butler who serves the last descendant of the now-deposed Suitoku royal family. Wugui was retained by the former king, but his demeanor and skills are uncharacteristic of a butler and his background is shrouded in mystery. He intends to use the current unrest in Japan to manipulate the government and restore the royal family.<br/><i>"It's time to purge."</i><br/><br/>Ao Tienyi (VA: Yumiri Hanamori)<br/>The last living descendant of the Suitoku royal family. When the royal family was dethroned, she was spirited away by Wugui and lived in hiding. She has agreed to Wugui’s plan to use the current unrest in Japan to rebuild her former kingdom. Tienyi is naturally timid, but decided to take on the role of the "bright and cheerful princess" after being deeply moved by Kotaro's acting.<br/><i>"Have I become the lady you wish for?"</i><br/><br/>Sistan (VA: Hisako Kanemoto)<br/>Originally an automated doll designed to bring joy to people, Sistan was reprogrammed by a certain nation to become a secret operative. She was dispatched to Japan on a mission to locate a ‘Divine Drive’ said to be able to predict any event or grant wishes.<br/><i>"I will execute my orders... and eliminate all obstacles..."</i><br/><br/><strong>About This Game</strong><br/>"Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward" is an original 2D fighting game. Our goal was to provide easy-to-understand gameplay so many people can enjoy the fun of fighting games.

We paid close attention to designing appealing character designs and animations that can only be expressed in old-school pixel art.<br/><br/>・Core "blocking" System<br/>Yatagarasu's core gameplay mechanic is the blocking / "BL" system, which centers on deflecting your opponent's attacks and counterattacking. This simple system makes it easy to understand and apply strategy in the game.<br/><br/>・Simple Game System<br/>For a modern fighting game, Yatagarasu is very straightforward. Our goal was to create a game that anyone can pick up and play but also offers deep gameplay.<br/><br/>・Commentary System<br/>In live settings, fighting games have an off-screen appeal that includes fun smack talk, cheering, and commentary to engage the audience.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">THIS IS A MATH GAME</h2><br/>All you do in this game is solve math problems.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INCREDIBLY DARK AND DISTURBING DESCRIPTIONS OF VIOLENCE</strong></h2><br/>WARNING!!!<br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer is incredibly dark and disturbing. You must listen to recordings made by the Serial Killer. These recordings describe violence against men, women, and children.  Only the most courageous Special Agents should attempt to enter the dungeons of the Math Problem Killer.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ENTER DISTUBRING DUNGEONS AND SOLVE THE KILLER'S CREEPY MATH</strong></h2><br/>The main gameplay mechanic of The Math Problem Killer is walking through dungeons and listening to the recordings of a sadistic serial killer recount how he stalked, abducted and tortured his victims., and ultimately solving a math problem based on those disturbing stories.  The ultimate goal of each level is to rescue an individual hostage that his being held at the end of the dungeon.  <br/><br/>As you walk through the dungeons, the killer will tell you stories about how he abducted or tortured a victim. In his stories there will be facts, such as when he abducted a victim, or how long he followed them, or how long he tortured them, or how long it took them to die.  He will then form a math question based on the facts from his stories.  Such as...<br/><br/><strong><i></i>"I want you to start with Andrea's age, then multiply that by the number of nails I hammered into her husband. Then add the number of minutes I made her hang in my dungeon. Then multiply this number by the number of minutes I tortured Andrea's neighbor."<i></i> </strong><br/><br/>You will need to listen to all of the recordings in the room in order to gather all of the information required to solve the question.  When you do have your answer, you must enter it into the keypad on the door to the next room. If your answer is correct, the door will open and you will repeat the process until you reach the last room with the hostage. If your answer is wrong, then the hostage dies immediately and you must start over. <br/><br/>At its core, The Math Problem Killer is a tense, slow paced, story centric, crime thriller, walking simulator.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>A CRIME THRILLER STORY</strong></h2><br/>The Math Problem Killer is a crime thriller. A sadistic serial killer, known as the Math Problem killer has been murdering people in the city of New Columbia. At the request of the mayor and state governor, a federal Serial Killer Task Force arrives to hunt down the Serial Killer. Within days of arrival, the Task Force recieves a communication from the illusive and dangerous killer.  He has taken a hostage named Bethany Morgan. He tells the Task Force the hostage location, but he also informs the task force that they may only send one agent inside, and that agent may not have any communication with the outside world. <br/><br/>You are the Task Force Special Agent that is chosen to enter the facility and attempt a rescue of Bethany Morgan. The game takes place over the course of 11 weeks, and follows the Serial Killer Task Force as it attempts to find and apprehend the Math Problem killer. Each week is a new dungeon that must be entered, and a new hostage that must be rescued.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/hanging_nails.gif?t=1708346357"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>THE KILLER WILL TELL YOU DISTURBING STORIES</strong></h2><br/>The Math Problem Killer is a sadistic and violent monster. He enjoys stalking, and torturing his victims. He also enjoys bragging about his exploits even more. Throughout each dungeon you will find recordings left by the killer. In each recording, he will recount with delight the various methods he employed to capture and torture his victims. You must be prepared to listen to unsettling and disturbing accountings of murder and violence towards, men, women and children. But remember, you are a special agent in the Serial Killer Task Force, and it is your job to rescue the hostage being held in the dungeons. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/keypad.gif?t=1708346357"><br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer has placed multiple recordings of pieces of a fact pattern and an accompanying complicated multi-part word problem in each room. The player must listen to the recordings and solve the math word problem that is presented. The answer to the math problem is the door code for the locked door. However, if the player enters a wrong answer the hostage will be immediately killed.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ONE MISTAKE AND THE HOSTAGE DIES</strong></h2><br/><strong>I wont kill the hostage...you will.</strong><br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer does not give you second chances. You must be accurate, or the hostage will die. In each room of each dungeon, you must solve a simple math word problem, and then enter your answer into the keypad on the locked door. If you enter an incorrect code, the hostage you are trying to rescue will be burned alive by hyrdoflouric acid. Think carefully special agent. There is zero margin for error. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/crate.gif?t=1708346357"><br/><br/>A single mistake will kill the hostage and cause the player to fail the level. <i>The Math Problem Killer</i> is a high consequence game in which one mistake will have dire consequences. So think carefully Special Agent.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>YOU WILL NEED A PENCIL AND PAPER</strong></h2><br/>In each room of each level, you will need to solve a math word problem, and use the answer as the code to open the locked door to the next room and ultimately the locked box that contains the hostage. The math word problems are not difficult, but you will need to gather the numbers from the disturbing stories told by the killer.  Essentially you must gather clues and piece them together in order to figure out the answer. The only way to successfully solve these math problems is utilize a pencil and piece of paper.  The player will need to write things down. Because one math mistake, and the hostage dies.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
