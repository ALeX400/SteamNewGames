To accomplish this task, you must collect key shards that have been scattered throughout the zoo. To find the key shards, you must solve puzzles within the animal enclosures. Once all the shards are collected, you can assemble the master key to unlock the source of the monster anomalies.<br/><br/><strong>EXPLORE THE ZOO:</strong><br/>You are free to explore the zoo grounds. Find puzzles and mazes, rogue monsters, and immerse yourself in this delightfully disturbing zoo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2101890/extras/explore.gif?t=1709757837"><br/><br/><strong>STAY ALIVE:</strong><br/>You must attempt to stay alive while inside the zoo.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

You can interact with them during the game, pet them, and shoo them away when they get in the way.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1993180/extras/Calico_glaskanie_v2.gif?t=1709663584"><br/><br/><strong>Extended customization options</strong><br/>The game is full of cats, but there could always be more!

Recruit elite operatives to build your squad, then engage in a sweeping campaign of sabotage and destruction. Deal with competing factions to build the resistance network and strike at German targets deep in occupied territory. However, the more chaos you cause, the more you’ll draw the merciless attention of the Gestapo secret police.<br/> <br/>In exciting missions inspired by the exploits of the Allies and French, the game expands on turn-based tactical concepts, bringing authentic World War 2 combat to life.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_customisation_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Customize and create your own trial patient.<br/>Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.<br/>Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. <br/>Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_NOAKS.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_barlow.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_doris.jpg?t=1709677975"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INVESTIGATE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_investigate_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. <br/>Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.<br/>The Process:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Thaumaturge_accolade_616x320_steam.png?t=1709742147"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/TT_claim_EN_small.png?t=1709742147"><br/><strong>The Thaumaturge is an isometric, story-rich RPG with a unique take on turn-based combat, character development features, and investigation mechanics</strong>, facing you with morally ambiguous choices – set in a world teeming with mysterious powers and strange ethereal beings called <strong>salutors</strong>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/City_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>The year is 1905. Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Buka_2.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>A <strong>thaumaturge</strong> bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for <strong>Wiktor Szulski</strong>, the game’s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktor’s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as <strong>salutors</strong> - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Wiktor_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Shape your story</strong> – as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. <br/></li><li><strong>Develop your character</strong> – creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. <br/></li><li><strong>Experience unique turn-based combat</strong> and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.<br/></li><li><strong>Influence and manipulate</strong> the temperaments of other characters to bend their will to your liking. <br/></li><li><strong>Tame the power of salutors</strong> – use the unique set of their skills to gain an advantage while exploring the world and when bringing your adversaries to their knees. <br/></li><li><strong>See the world that’s inevitably gone</strong> – explore the uncommon, heavily researched historic period of the early XX century Warsaw, where crime and luxury are often two sides of the same coin. Meet historical figures and learn about their involvement in the story. <br/></li><li><strong>Created in Unreal Engine 5</strong> to deliver a detailed &amp; beautifully crafted world.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709562813"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709562813"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709562813"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709562813"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Impress them by winning and they will change their tone.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707900/extras/N-R_BODY_IMAGE_6.png?t=1708958635"><br/>Earn cash by beating racers in 1vs1 wagers but be warned; these are real wagers and you will lose the money you bet if you lose the race! Some racers will take pity on you and give you a chance to win your money back by suggesting a 'double or nothing' race. It's your choice if you want to take that risk.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Fulfill your epic destiny in mythic ancient China! Lead armies, wield magic, and put an emperor on the throne - or become the emperor yourself!<br/><br/><i>Tale of Two Cranes</i> is a 750,000-word interactive epic historical fantasy novel by Michelle Balaban and Stephanie Balaban.  It’s entirely text based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/>The mighty Qin dynasty has fallen. As the land breaks into warring states, everyone must choose their side in the growing civil war. <br/><br/>Within this epic turmoil, you have been chosen to fulfill a grand but mysterious destiny. You are a Yǒngshì warrior, bonded with a heavenly spirit that grants you magical powers, and trained since childhood in the arts of battle. Your spirit is greater than any Yǒngshì has ever been: you are the mortal link to the Red-Crowned Crane, a mystical patron unique among all of the heavens…or so you thought. As war rises around you, you discover that there is a rival: Chan Ming, bonded to the Other Crane, is the only person who could ever match your power - or he might even exceed it.<br/><br/>Your mystical power can sway the course of the war and determine who will be the next emperor. Whose faction will you choose: Liu Bang, a charismatic lord beloved by the people; or Xiang Yu, a veteran of war respected by the military? Can you navigate the politics of the Imperial court, or will you gather your power in seclusion at your country estate? When China’s enemies encroach from the northern steppes, can you negotiate with them to call a truce - or even win them over as allies? Will you prove your loyalty to the new Emperor, or will you betray your allies at every turn? Uncover conspiracies of spies, trace the source of rebellions and mutinies, blackmail an Empress, marry into the Imperial family to become the power behind the throne - or even become the Emperor yourself!<br/><br/>And through it all, cross paths and swords with your rival, the Other Crane. Will you defeat him in an epic battle for the ages, or will you join him and create the most powerful mystical partnership the realm has ever known? <br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, bi or asexual.<br/></li><li>Find romance amongst your six closest allies or opt for an arranged marriage.<br/></li><li>Choose from four magical classes: mystic, militant, sage or strategist.<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of your mystical link to the Crane and discover the truth behind your unique connection to a fellow warrior.<br/></li><li>Fight epic battles across a landscape inspired by the Warring States period of ancient China.<br/></li><li>Build your personal power, customizing your estate to create a place specializing in military training, agriculture, spiritual enlightenment, scholarship, commerce, and more!<br/></li><li>Master the Imperial court to propel yourself into the administration, nobility, or even to become ruler of all China! </li></ul><br/>Your destiny calls, and a new dynasty awaits!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							It’s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics – a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. <br/><br/>Your mission? Work your way around the island’s six neighbourhoods – from the rust buckets of Betty’s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay – challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2569820/extras/Gif1.gif?t=1709810955"><br/><br/>No two games are the same as you work your way through 40 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2569820/extras/Gif2.gif?t=1709810955"><br/><br/>Octane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team’s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2569820/extras/Gif3.gif?t=1709810955"><br/><br/>Just about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Manic arcade action</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>40 levels</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Six unique neighbourhoods</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Local and online couch co-op</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Local and online versus mode</li></ul> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The Cursed House series is the trickiest Match3 Puzzle game out there, and this one is no exception. As usual, there are some new twists in the game mechanics, a fresh set of levels, and some of them are quite challenging, even seemingly impassable at first glance. But don't worry; if you can't figure out what to do, there's an interactive HINT button (we're continuously improving its functionality with each project, making it more accurate and interactive), so you won't get stuck.<br>
<br>
And of course, there are some bonus games included, such as Spot the Difference, Hidden Objects, Solitaire, and Sokoban. Plus, there's a town to unspell.<br>
<br>
You can play in Timed, Relaxed, or Limited Moves modes. Additionally, you can replay levels you enjoy, or skip all the bonus games and come back to them later if you prefer.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

same school, and the heroine of Part II. <br/><br/>Her father the boss of a crime syndicate, Kotoko still has a sense of what is just and right.<br/>With Itsuki and the gang in twenty million yen of debt, she hopes to be of at least some use to them, having herself given permission for their business.<br/>Thanks to rumors about the daughter of a crime lord attending the school, Kotoko spends a lot of time alone, without anyone she can truly call a friend.<br/>Unfamiliar with romance, she puts on a brave front when the topics arises despite her internal unrest.<br/>She likes stationery and accessories with panda designs on.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2730350/extras/chara02.png?t=1709806031"><br/>Meryl Hathaway  (Voice: Nene Arisu) <br/><br/>Due to her slight build and indifferent temperament, she gives off the impression of being fragile.<br/>However, she proves to have extraordinary skills when handling emergencies.<br/>She likes sweet things.<br/><br/>Meryl seems to stand on an equal footing with Kotoko, and the Yakuza treat her with the utmost respect.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2730350/extras/chara03.png?t=1709806031"><br/>Rin Akinashi  (Voice: Cyclamen Kaori) <br/><br/>The protagonist’s long-time acquaintance and fellow classmate.<br/>A paragon of perfection with good looks, exemplary behavior, and excellent grades, she’s popular with boys and girls alike at school.<br/>However, this is merely a mask, hiding the cunning, scheming vixen she really is.<br/><br/>Despite having been raised in a wealthy environment, she has an extreme attachment to money, and earns a fortune working with Hina to operate a large scale business of her own.<br/>When trouble arises in her business venture with Itsuki, she at first attempts to wash her hands of it, but thanks to Hina's intervention she remains to search for solutions with the rest of the gang.<br/><br/>She is meticulous in hiding her own footsteps, and never makes contact with anyone other than Itsuki and Hina.<br/><br/><img

friends, but is herself friendly and likable.<br/><br/>She places her full trust in Itsuki, and the two of them have overcome dangerous situations together.<br/>While she and Itsuki are not lovers, they do share a connection of sorts.<br/><br/>Currently a party to Rin's business, she also aids Itsuki and the gang in their venture.<br/><br/><img

delinquent-filled so-called “Badman Academy,” he is also the leader of DREAD.<br/><br/>Similar to Hina, he isn’t choosy about the methods he uses to earn money for reasons of his own and doesn’t hesitate to resort to violence at times.<br/>With the Yakuza at his back, his money-making activities are a far cry from your average student’s.<br/><br/>He sees Itsuki as a friend, and Itsuki trusts him in return.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2730350/extras/chara06.png?t=1709806031"><br/>Shiori Iida  (Voice: Nanoka Osaka) <br/><br/>The schoolgirl responsible for Itsuki and the gang being saddled with twenty million yen of debt.<br/><br/>The owner of a strong sense of self-preservation, Shiori blames any inconvenient truth on others.<br/>It seems she has been attending school as though nothing happened ever since the incident.<br/>While she puts on a refined act at school, in reality she is anything but.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2730350/extras/chara07.png?t=1709806031"><br/>Koji  (Voice: nozoru) <br/><br/>A student at Badman Academy and a former member of

Sho Sakuma) <br/><br/>A teacher at Badman Academy, Shoji is a regular customer of Rin and Hina's business.<br/>With strong connections to other such regular customers, he actively cooperates with Itsuki and Hina.<br/>A basically decent person—despite some of his more "unusual" preferences.<br/><br/><img

Kotoko's father.<br/>Despite the nature of the family business, he wishes for a normal life for his daughter.<h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2>Rin Akinashi and Itsuki Ninomae embark on a certain "business venture" using a video of Itsuki's creation.<br/><br/>Rin's business partner, Hina Yorozuya, enlists her brother Tatsuya's aid, and the group gradually begins to make a success of their business, although not without some trouble along the way. However, a certain incident leaves them saddled with twenty million in debt to the Yakuza.<br/><br/>Hoping to break free of this situation, Itsuki and the gang make contact with Kotoko Teshigawara, the daughter of the syndicate's boss, with the aim of forming an alliance.<br/><br/>Their enemy: A crime lord. Their target: His daughter.<br/>Can our heroes survive in the face of overwhelming violence?						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
