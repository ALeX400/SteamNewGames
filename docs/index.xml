<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE01_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG1.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG2.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE02_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG3.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE03_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG4.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE04_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE05_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG5.gif?t=1709230146"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera. Each photograph you take will translate the name of the content into Japanese and English so you can learn with your surroundings.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Take_Photo.gif?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A stylised, approachable 3D environment<br/></li><li>In-game photography system<br/></li><li>Japanese audio<br/></li><li>Photo album to store your flash cards<br/></li><li>A game mode that tests your memory<br/></li><li>Beginner phrases and grammar lessons<br/></li><li>Day/Night and weather cycle<br/></li><li>Display romaji, kana, furigana <i>(recommended)</i> or kanji</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Flash_Cards.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Create Stunning Photography Based Flashcards</h2>Every photo flash-card you take will be unique to you. The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Photo_Album.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Track Your Progress in the Photo Album</h2>Your photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif1.gif?t=1709216510"><br/><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance</strong> is a <strong>real-time strategy game</strong> based on the Terminator: Dark Fate universe that follows the war between humanity and Legion's synthetic intelligent machine network.<br/><br/>In the<strong> single-player campaign</strong>, you take the role of a commander in the Founders, a force made up of the remnants of the US military and guide your army in an attempt to foil Legion's plan to exterminate the last remnants of humanity. In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion.<br/><br/>Take control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps. Make decisions about unit placement, battle tactics and abilities so that you don’t just survive but can become the leader of the resistance against the machines. Hone your skills and military expertise by replaying and achieving the best possible outcomes.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Dynamic battlefields: realistic tactics and consequences</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif2.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>Engage in complex, realistic battles where your <strong>tactical decisions</strong> are vital to your survival and ultimate victory. Use a variety of military equipment, vehicles and ammunition types in your battles against the enemy. Recruit and train new units, assign new skills and acquire new weapons and equipment to continue the resistance.<br/><br/>Encounter tense battles. Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/title.png?t=1709280033"><br/><br/>You’re a hitman in one of the top three crime organizations fighting to the death over territory and the flow of illegal booze. It’s your job to follow orders and come out alive on the other side, no matter how risky, how brutal, or how unlikely it might seem that you’ll reach your mark. Jump, slide, sneak, or just barge right in – you’ll have to do whatever it takes to get the kill.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/mob_boss_takedown_cmprsd.gif?t=1709280033"><br/><br/><br/>As, <i>Of Murder and Moonshine’s</i> pixel art and dark, jazzy score give the game a gritty, nostalgic feel to punctuate the systematic killings you must carry out throughout cities and the bayou in order to appease your boss and ensure your crime syndicate comes out on top at all costs.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><strong>Choose your weapon</strong><br/>Start each level by choosing your preferred tool of the trade. From tommy guns to baseball bats, there’s a strategic choice for every situation.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Survey the task ahead or run in guns blazing </strong><br/>Depending on the scenario, you may employ a careful, covert operation where you survey the scene and plan out each step, or you may find yourself thrown right to the wolves and need to fight your way out from the inside. Either way, you have to take out your mark or find yourself on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/shtgn_slide_store_page_ready_c.gif?t=1709280033"><br/><br/><br/><strong>Hide your intentions for covert hits</strong><br/>Alternate between brandishing your weapon and keeping it discreetly concealed in your overcoat to suit the situation at hand. You’ll never get to your mark and have an opportunity to take him down if you get stopped at the door by guards who see your intentions a mile away. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Expect to suffer for your mistakes</strong><br/>When you answer to the most ambitious crime boss the city has ever seen, you can’t expect to get any slack for sloppy work. The jobs you’re sent on are punishing, and you’ll pay with your life if you don’t succeed, but that risk is what makes victory taste all that much sweeter.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Take down killer bosses</strong><br/>When you’re part of a crime ring, it’s not only your own boss you need to worry about. Use what you’ve learned taking out lesser goons to bring down the big baddies—rival crime bosses who will do anything it takes to put an end to your mission. Boss fights mean tougher battles and bigger wins, so you’ll have to make use of new strategies, like employing molotov cocktails or honing your sniping skills, to take them down. Will you and your gang be able to conquer the swamps and the city, or will a rival crew bring you to your knees?						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Dot Hop is a grid-based puzzle game. Find a path from start to end without leaving any dots behind. You can't move backwards, but you can hop over dots you've already dotted. Some of these can get pretty tricky, but the knots are pretty satisfying to unravel.<br/><br/>Dot Hop has 72 puzzles and over 1000 dots to be hopped. I'm planning to add more puzzles and themes over time, pretty much indefinitely - I love exploring this puzzle pattern and trying to come up with harder shapes. The puzzles are created by hand for now, but a generator is in the works.<br/><br/>Dot Hop's origin story is covered in this short youtube devlog: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfdHTPWyWvA" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yfdHTPWyWvA</a><br/><br/>You can also find the source on github: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frussmatney%2Fdothop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/russmatney/dothop</a> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"In Out Path" is a puzzle-solving game where you control a cat on a journey to find redemption. However, various birds will block your progress along the way. As animals can only travel along certain paths, you need to use mechanisms that can change the positional relationships between animals to construct a safe path. The game consists of 7 chapters, each with different themed landscapes and music. It offers over 20 different mechanisms and more than 300 levels.<br/><br/>Join Our Discord:<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FFZNvzZxG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/FZNvzZxG</a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f0.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>Our game's core gameplay revolves around "position swapping". The first chapter introduces the basic game mechanics: moving paths and red birds. Moving paths are mechanisms that cause a path to move when an animal touches them. Red birds act as enemies for the cat - if the cat touches a red bird, it fails. Through the use of switches and moving paths, players can change the positional relationship between the cat and the birds to create a safe path for the cat to pass through. <br/><br/>In subsequent levels after the first chapter, the game presents various variations of moving paths, including rotation, stretching, and multi-segment path swapping. However, each variation is not too difficult and serves more as a showcase and guide. The difficulty gradually increases in the last few levels of the first chapter. The puzzle elements are clearly displayed on the map, and there is no need to search for hidden items. The focus is more on testing the player's logical reasoning in applying the existing mechanisms. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f1.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>In the second chapter, the game introduces multiple new mechanisms while continuing the design style of the first chapter. Each mechanism is introduced in a few small levels to teach its basic usage, and the real challenge comes in the later levels. This design allows players to smoothly experience most of the content in each chapter while still providing a certain level of challenge. It feels like slicing vegetables before facing the ultimate boss.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f2.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>Most puzzle games are confined to a 2D plane, but our game incorporates "3D stereoscopic" as an important part of puzzle design from the beginning. The third chapter introduces a jumping mechanism. The cat can perform long-range jumps using a swing. It can jump over birds on flat ground and onto higher ground on maps with elevated terrain. The maps of the first two chapters can be considered as a 2D plane, but starting from the third chapter, the game officially enters a three-dimensional world. New puzzle-solving methods like aerial collisions and switching between different levels of terrain liberate players from the constraints of a 2D world and truly immerse them in a three-dimensional game. We believe that breaking free from the limitations of the 2D plane can lead to the creation of better games.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f3.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>The fourth chapter introduces a special bird - the purple bird. The cat can exert a force on the purple bird to move it closer or farther away. This mechanic is similar to pushing boxes, but it is different from the traditional box-pushing mechanic. The operation of exerting force remotely requires players to have control over the position between the cat and the purple bird. Combined with the three-dimensional multi-level maps, players have to consider more factors compared to simple 2D box-pushing.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f4.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>Starting from the fifth chapter, the game introduces many elements that require operational skills, such as snowballs and timers that require calculating time. The wind blowing mechanism in the sixth chapter and the duplication mechanism in the seventh chapter also require a certain level of player skill. However, we have added teleportation houses as a mechanism with classic "position swapping" functionality to add flavor. Although these levels require operational skills, we have tried to provide players with a certain margin of error, as we want operation to be just a seasoning, with logical reasoning being the main course of the game.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f5.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>After completing the regular levels, players face the challenge of the expansion levels in each chapter. Although the expansion levels are unlocked after completing the regular levels of each chapter, they are significantly more difficult. If the regular levels are like playing "Dynasty Warriors," then the expansion levels are like playing "Dark Souls." Clearly, the regular levels only act as appetizers, while the expansion levels reveal the true nature of the game. This is why the regular levels may give a feeling of showcasing and guiding the player.<br/><br/>However, the expansion levels do not introduce new mechanisms or require the use of existing mechanisms in new ways to complete the levels. The content of the game consists of various combinations of existing mechanisms from the regular levels. It's like a teacher teaching you mathematical formulas and now expecting you to use these formulas to solve various problems.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f6.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>The characteristics of the game can be summarized as follows:<br/>1. The game progresses from a 2D plane to a 3D plane with operational elements, gradually demanding more cognitive and operational skills from the players, creating a basic difficulty curve.<br/>2. The regular levels ensure a rhythm of unlocking new mechanisms at regular intervals, providing a continuous sense of freshness.<br/>3. The final few levels of the regular levels are relatively difficult, ensuring a certain degree of challenge.<br/>4. Most of the challenging levels are reserved for the expansion levels, allowing most players to smoothly experience the game while retaining depth.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f7.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>Furthermore, getting stuck is a normal situation in puzzle games. To assist players who get stuck, we have implemented a hint system in the game. The hint system provides a simple gameplay recording for players to reference. Players can see the key points of completing the current level in the video recording. We hope that players can comfortably enjoy the game without feeling frustrated by being stuck on a particular level.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2572360/extras/f8.jpg?t=1709256504"><br/><br/>With our sincere love for puzzle games, we have created "In Out Path", hoping to convey our passion to every player and let more people experience the joy of puzzle games.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2572360/InOutPath/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2572360/InOutPath/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>All City King</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2793820/All_City_King/?snr=1_239_new__tab-AllNewReleases</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2793820/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							All City King is a stealth game where the player takes the role of an up-and-coming street<br>
artist. Your target is the subway trains and your goal is to make your art travel all over the<br>
city.<br>
Some games allow you to heist a bank where you take out the guards and escape with a<br>
giant pay-check. But in All City King, your “bank” is the trains, and your “pay-check” is your<br>
art or whatever message you feel fit to share. Enter the subway quietly, make your mark on<br>
the trains, and get out.<br/>
As you start your career as a street artist and after you have learned the ropes, your goal is<br/>
to spray paint subway cars in increasingly difficult missions. Sneak past patrolling security<br/>
guards, leave your mark on subway trains, and watch as your masterpiece leaves the<br/>
station!<br/>
<br/>
