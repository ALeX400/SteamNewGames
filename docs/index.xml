<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Astral Party is a board party game that supports online multiplayer with up to 4 players. This is a free to play game, with in-app purchases like skins, dress-ups that do not affect the gameplay balance. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622000/extras/星引擎释放技能.gif?t=1709173208"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Board Party Game with Suspenses</strong></h2>A board game like no other! 15 different panel effects, random effects and events make every game full of suspense and unpredictability. With the roll of dice, you always have chances to turn the tables at the last minute.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622000/extras/星引擎随机事件.gif?t=1709173208"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Over 10 Cute Anime Girls</strong></h2>This is an exciting dicing battle with vivid Characters, each with unique skills and beautiful illustration. 10 characters are available as the game launches, and will have more as updates add.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>4-Person Online Matches or Single Play with AI</strong></h2>Play how you want. Astral Party allows 1 to 4 players to compete online, or single-person play with AI. It's all the same friendship ruining fun.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Dices &amp; Cards &amp; Battles &amp; More</strong></h2>The crux of Astral Party lies in its one-on-one dice-based combat system, with a myriad of cards, effects, skill, events, and more. Card plays can augment your attack, and the dice decides if it is dodged. Every attack is like a small gamble, and nothing is more chilling than the moment you presume victory is within your grasp.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622000/extras/星引擎战斗.gif?t=1709173208"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Monsters Spice Up the Game More</strong></h2>As the game advances, monsters will surface on the board, some attacking players and others merely stealing coins. In the end, a formidable Boss will appear and relentlessly target the richest player. If it is you, be wary of other players’ "backstabs". (PS: Try beat the Boss to find out if there is reward dropping)<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622000/extras/星引擎boss_640x360_5s.gif?t=1709173208"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Victory Condition</strong></h2>Players rake in some coins to level up, and the first player hitting level 3 becomes the victor. Be quick to turn those shiny coins into levels, cause you never know if you are still rich in the next turn.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622000/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622000/</a> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

This is game design based on psychology as much as rules.” </i><br/>- Quarter to Three<br/><br/><i>“More than any game I've played in years, Solium Infernum nails the sensation of staring at a screen and losing yourself in the cold glory of a difficult decision.”</i><br/>- Game Developer (formerly Gamasutra)<br/><br/><i>“Solium Infernum kicked my knees out from under me ... this game took my past experience with strategy games and threw it, like a pro basketball player, into a bin eighty feet away.”</i><br/>- Eurogamer<br/><br/><i>“One of the best games of the year.”</i><br/>— Three Moves Ahead<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_toReign.png?t=1708670283"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Take life by the horns in Goat Simulator 3 today!<br/><br/>Gather your herd and venture forth into Goat Simulator 3; an all-new*, totally realistic**, sandbox farmyard*** experience that puts you back in the hooves of no one's favourite female protagonist.<br/><br/>Join Pilgor and get ready to create your own whirlwind adventure on the island of San Angora. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through our open world in the biggest waste of your time since the original Goat Simulator! We won't tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/AnnouncementTrailer_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>If your dreams contain more than one goat, that works for us! In Goat Simulator 3, you can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op to create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. And don't worry, there are plenty of customisation options so you and your pals don't wear clashing outfits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Customization_Minigames_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>Goat Simulator 3 first launched in November 2022, and since then our “game designers” have been hard at work adding even more weird and wondrous stuff. As well as all the original goat-y goodness, Steam players will be able to experience all content from the game’s post-launch updates; including the Mandatory Holiday Update, Operation Crackdown and the Shadiest Update, with more to come!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Steam_Promo_Image_Group_Shot_757.png?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/>- You can be a goat<br/>- You can be a goat… on Steam!<br/>- Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op<br/>- No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There's a goat for everyone!<br/>- Dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care<br/>- We have actual 'game designers' who have worked to create 'an okay amount of content'; including events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak<br/>- They've added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?)<br/>- They’ve even added a bunch of extra content since the game first launched, aren’t you a bunch of lucky kids?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Gameplay_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br/>Since it launched in November 2022, Goat Simulator 3 has been a completely stupid game. It is still a completely stupid game today, except now it has more stuff! By this point if you're not sure what you're getting into, we can't help you.<br/><br/><strong>NOTES:</strong><br/>* Goat Simulator 3 is technically not completely new, but it is new to Steam users!<br/>** Our game is very realistic, if you happen to be a digital goat with a proclivity for ragdolling.<br/>*** False alarm, this one is actually true.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You will play as a pancake chef, on a never-ending snack cart, constantly making “chinese crepes” for the customers who come by, and getting ratings and ingredients.<br/><br/>First sprinkle some flour, beat some eggs, add some scallions, and finally add some toppings, spread some sauce, and a piece of authentic 'Jianbing guozi' is freshly baked!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2> <ul class="bb_ul"><li>Cyberpunk art<br/></li><li>Sensational music<br/></li><li>Easy to play<br/></li><li>Rich ingredients<br/></li><li>Realistic cooking simulation<br/></li><li>Most items on the snack cart can be interacted with<br/></li><li>Immersive gaming experience</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>In 2098, although the technology of the earth has “progressed”, human civilization has taken another path. The “humanism” spirit brought by the Renaissance was replaced by “technologism”. People believe that the development of technology will bring unlimited freedom and even create infinite possibilities. For example, the invention of electronic brains allows people to truly feel what is “imagination without boundaries”. The invention of electronic limbs and auxiliary body parts allows people to see and accept the death of God in religion and the birth of God in technology.<br/><br/>People have become accustomed to and enjoy letting technology dominate everything, from birth to death, from three meals a day to work and leisure, as long as they have money, they can live like gods. There has never been a kind of capitalism that makes everyone so firmly believe in the power of money. Money buys technology, and technology summons God.<br/><br/>Of course, the remnants of the old enlightenment’s “humanism” have not been extinct. They can always survive on the edge of cities and networks. In 2098, in New Dragon City of the American Federation, an organization called “Imune” removes identity chips for people for free, to get rid of the information control of the capital government union on individuals. At the same time, the advertising department of Pineapple Dragon, the largest company in New Dragon City, is hunting down “Imune”. The player-controlled “chef” is one of the leaders of “Imune”. According to the law designated by Pineapple Dragon and the government, such a thought criminal as “Imune” will be subjected to “thought deprivation” punishment, implanting brain invasion accessors for criminals, and providing some customers with special services-legal brain invasion (role-playing), to deprive thought criminals of their right to use their own brains.<br/><br/>Some thought criminals will act as cleaners on the outer walls of skyscrapers, some will be arranged as executioners for illegal violent organizations, and of course, there are also some low-stimulation occupations, such as some thought criminals will be assigned to snack stalls as stall owners. It should be noted that this service is different from the “Braindance” system used by ordinary customers. After all, BD is just a kind of “replay”, but this service provides a kind of “realest experience”. Customers can see in reality the consequences caused by their own actions.<br/><br/>In snack cart No. 98, players will invade into the brain of a former leader of the “Imune” organization, play as a chef, cook pancakes and get feedback from “customers”.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Survival justifies any means! As one of the special agents in the world of [Special Force Legion of Monsters], you should do everything to survive among 10 opponents. Your every action must be based on your survival tactics. Will you become a wise survivor or a bloodthirsty predator? Will you play as a team or solo? How will you hunt threatening monsters to acquire lethal weapons and useful utilities? There is no answer; survival is the only answer.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><br/><u>Survive or Kill</u><br/><br/>There are countless ways to be the last one in [Special Force Legion of Monsters]. If you are a defensive survivor, you should be well-prepared by hunting monsters and collecting utilities and weapons. If you are a relentless assassinator, get your gun ready, kill innocent victims, and take their items to get stronger.<br/><br/><u>Players are Not the Only Enemies</u><br/><br/>Elf archers disguise in a bush to blow your brains out, and your bullets do not work against those golems.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Alexander Parker, a brilliant scientist, found himself trapped in an experimental quantum reality simulator. The cutting-edge technology was designed to challenge the mind, pushing the boundaries of human cognition. However, something went terribly wrong during the test, and Alexander became entangled within the virtual labyrinth with no apparent way out.<br/><br/>Inside the simulation, Alexander discovered that he had to navigate through a series of increasingly complex levels. Each level presented unique challenges and puzzles that tested his intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The catch was that failure to solve a level or making the wrong move could result in a simulated "death," resetting him back to the beginning.<br/><br/>As Alexander delved deeper into the quantum labyrinth, he encountered surreal landscapes, mind-bending puzzles, and even faced virtual adversaries. He realized that escaping this digital maze required not just scientific knowledge but also a strategic and adaptable mindset.<br/><br/>The simulation mirrored his memories and experiences, creating a surreal blend of reality and fiction. Alexander encountered manifestations of his own fears and doubts, forcing him to confront and overcome personal obstacles as he progressed through the levels.<br/><br/>He spent countless simulated hours deciphering cryptic codes, navigating optical illusions, and outsmarting virtual enemies. The lines between the real and virtual worlds blurred, challenging Alexander's sanity and resolve. Yet, fueled by determination and a desire to return to the real world, he pressed on.<br/><br/>Throughout his journey, Alexander discovered hidden messages left by the simulation's creators, guiding him and providing clues about the nature of his predicament. He began to suspect that the experiment was not just a test of intellect but a deeper exploration of the human psyche.<br/><br/>As he approached the final level, the challenges became more abstract and metaphysical. Alexander faced a mirror version of himself, a manifestation of his own consciousness. To escape, he had to confront his inner demons, accept his flaws, and integrate his experiences into a coherent understanding of self.<br/><br/>With a final burst of insight, Alexander cracked the code of the quantum labyrinth. The simulation glitched, and reality warped around him. Suddenly, he found himself back in the laboratory, breathing heavily, with the virtual maze dissipating like a digital illusion.<br/><br/>The experiment, though perilous, had changed Alexander. He emerged with a profound appreciation for the fragility of the human mind and the importance of self-discovery. The quantum labyrinth had been a journey of both intellect and introspection, leaving Alexander forever altered by the ordeal.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1361870/extras/wishlist.gif?t=1709167220"> </img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>On a warm summer night, when the stars twinkle like fireflies and the rustling leaves whisper secrets in the deep woods, a captivating fairy tale weaves itself like magic around the flickering flames of a campfire. </i><br/><i>This story began in a majestic Сastle on a Rock. Once upon a time there reigned a noble Lord loved and revered by his subjects. In his pursuit of wealth and safety, the Lord pressed upon the forest dwellers who called the thicket their home. The wild creatures were compelled to abandon their nests and retreat deeper into the woods. As years flowed like a river, the kingdom flourished, and the Lord's legacy continued through his two heirs. In a world where tradition dictated that the elder son ascend the throne, the younger one's heart seethed with jealousy that painted his thoughts a shade of darkness. In a moment when the old Lord breathed his last, his elder son found himself framed. His left hand was severed from his body by the very sibling he once called kin. The pain of betrayal and his father's death propelled him into a desperate escape, and he vanished deep into the woods.<br/>In the heart of those enchanted woods, where ancient secrets were whispered through the rustling leaves, the elder son encountered the Wild Spirit – a sentinel of the land, as old as the forest itself. This guardian of the woods extended him a helping hand, infusing the elder son's life with new purpose, granting him the ability to summon the very creatures his father had once displaced.</i><br/><br/><i>End of story? Not at all. Everything is just beginning for you. <br/>Embrace the power that springs forth from the heart of the woods, and let your journey through this fairy tale awaken the hero within you!</i><br/><br/><br/><strong>What am I supposed to do?</strong><br/>Guided by instinct and your own strategic acumen, you wield the power to dictate the ebb and flow of battle. Each encounter becomes a tactical dance, an intricate interplay of forces where you strategically choose and deploy your allies – the Sprigs – to conquer trials and adversaries that bar your path. The secret lies in the cards that adorn your left hand, each bearing the essence of a specific Spring. As you deftly select and unveil these cards, you set in motion a symphony of magic and nature, your chosen allies springing to life to face the challenges that await.<br/><br/><strong>Who are my enemies?</strong><br/>Once-noble knights. Their honor washed away like the fading memories of a distant era. Clad in tarnished armor, the knights wield an arsenal of weaponry. They grip bows with arrows that whistle through the air, seeking to pierce your defenses. Maces swing in heavy arcs, seeking to crush your resistance with sheer force. Swords gleam menacingly, slicing through the air with a deadly elegance. Hammers, gripped tightly, strike the earth and unleash shockwaves, threatening to shatter your resolve.<br/><br/><strong>What do my Sprigs have against them?</strong><br/>Within the embrace of the ancient forest, your loyal Sprigs emerge, each adorned with an array of weaponry as diverse as the foliage that surrounds them. <br/>One of your steadfast companions wields a formidable wooden club. Another brandishes a massive log, a symbol of their unyielding connection to the land. A third ally grips a gleaming sword, poised to cleave through the ranks of your adversaries. Another companion dons a stout shield and thrusts forward with a sharpened spear. Twin daggers glint in the dappled sunlight, wielded by another of your comrades with swift precision. And amidst the clash of steel, an ally hefts a massive ax, each swing cleaving through opposition with a resounding impact.<br/>Beyond the physical arsenal that accompanies you, your magic gauntlet pulses with arcane energy. Within its depths, spells of great power lie dormant, awaiting your command.<br/><br/><strong>I want to have more power </strong><br/>Well, here's a little-known secret that the forest whispers to you in its ancient tongue. As you vanquish these fallen knights, a shimmering residue remains – the essence of their shattered dignity and lost glory. These soul fragments hold a hidden power, one that can be harnessed and saved within your piggy bank – a mystical repository of souls.<br/>With each soul captured, the piggy bank resonates with a pulsating energy, a testament to the knights' struggles and their eventual redemption through your actions. These souls become your currency of growth, allowing you to venture deeper into the forest's heart and unlock the potential power of your Sprigs.						</div></div>]]></description>
