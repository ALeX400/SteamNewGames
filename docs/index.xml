A lush temperate isle home to three great magical cultures - Boran, Apatut, and Kuqkwa - including one bright-eyed newcomer, Abrill. After crashing onto the island during her travels to a magical academy, the young witch makes the most of the situation, still eager to become a full-fledged Witch. Instead of waiting idly for her arrival, the Academy of Witches also decided to use this as an opportunity for young Abrill to demonstrate her mastery of magic… And unveil the secrets of the mysterious island.<br/><br/>But know this: Becoming the Witch of Fern Island isn't just about passing exams! It's about finding your place in the world, making friends, and most importantly, finding joy within every passing moment.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1550010/extras/1.gif?t=1709065958"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1550010/extras/WFI-Steam-Title-Banner_Master.png?t=1709065958"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Graduation means meeting the expectations of the Academy's Guardian Witch, and not by sitting through boring lectures.

							Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera. Each photograph you take will translate the name of the content into Japanese and English so you can learn with your surroundings.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Take_Photo.gif?t=1709057685"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A stylised, approachable 3D environment<br/></li><li>In-game photography system<br/></li><li>Japanese audio<br/></li><li>Photo album to store your flash cards<br/></li><li>A game mode that tests your memory<br/></li><li>Beginner phrases and grammar lessons<br/></li><li>Day/Night and weather cycle</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Flash_Cards.png?t=1709057685"><h2 class="bb_tag">Create Stunning Photography Based Flashcards</h2>Every photo flash-card you take will be unique to you. The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Photo_Album.png?t=1709057685"><h2 class="bb_tag">Track Your Progress in the Photo Album</h2>Your photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif1.gif?t=1709033791"><br/><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance</strong> is a <strong>real-time strategy game</strong> based on the Terminator: Dark Fate universe that follows the war between humanity and Legion's synthetic intelligent machine network.<br/><br/>In the<strong> single-player campaign</strong>, you take the role of a commander in the Founders, a force made up of the remnants of the US military and guide your army in an attempt to foil Legion's plan to exterminate the last remnants of humanity.

Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Lead the survival of mankind</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif3.gif?t=1709033791"><br/>Recruit others to your cause and <strong>grow your army</strong>.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							THE GAME AWARDS is a mockumentary-style genre swapper that cycles between third-person speed-platforming collectathon, third-person hack-n-slash action title, and third-person exploration/adventure game. Expect platforming, collectibles, enemies to be slashed and defeated, vast maps to be explored, and the occasional linear hallway for narrative purposes. With these ingredients, a lone developer—who started learning Unreal Engine four weeks ago—will (try to) deliver you a game fit to win the "best indie game" award at Jeff Keeley's The Game Awards. Not to be confused with that other popular game awards show hosted by a guy whose name starts with a G.<br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong><br/>- Three distinct game genres and experiences (Platform! Fight! Walk!)<br/>- A smorgasbord of jokes—written jokes, narrated jokes, visual jokes, and even a few good jokes<br/>- A gripping narrative, depending on your familiarity with game development and Norm Macdonald<br/>- Cinematic presentation and minimal HUD elements offer a premium aesthetic to distract from game mechanic simplicity<br/>- Can be beaten in under two hours, for those of you who don't like games that overstay their welcome<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>- Again, there's platforming, fighting (with weapons), and walking (with feet). There are only so many ways to rephrase this information. Press buttons, do things.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">BACKSTORY</h2>You are a student journalist who decides to make a documentary about the abandoned «North» cosmodrome, where in the 1990s a series of man-made disasters occurred that caused serious genetic changes in humans and animals, forming previously unknown mutations. Almost the entire population was evacuated, and an exclusion zone appeared on the territory of the cosmodrome along with the nearest settlements.<br/><br/>Two of your friends, who are well-versed in these places and know how to get to the abandoned spaceport, are going on an expedition with you. They drove ahead, and you followed them in your car. But halfway along the way, a snowstorm began and you did not notice how you turned the wrong way, strayed from other members of the expedition and got stuck in the middle of the forest in the exclusion zone. Attempts to contact friends were unsuccessful. Deciding that the spaceport is not too far away, you decide to walk the rest of the route alone through the forest, taking your camera with you.<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2>This is a game in the genre of "found footage", where you control the camera of a character in the first person. You will be able to explore a really huge exclusion zone, encounter paranormal phenomena, plunge into the mystical atmosphere of the winter forest and perhaps you will be able to find out the real reason for the closure of the «North» cosmodrome.<br/><br/>Found Footage: Paranormal — offers you a unique experience of immersion in the atmosphere of real chthonic horror, using realistic Unreal Engine 5 graphics, sophisticated sound design and a system of random encounters with entities during your journey. Do not forget, the world in which you find yourself lives by its own rules and your appearance in it will not go unnoticed.<h2 class="bb_tag">What will you do if you find yourself in the forest at night?</h2> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Guragura Oden" is a casual balance puzzle game.<br>
Pile up the ingredients high in the unstable shaking earthenware pot.<br>
<br>
Ingredients<br>
Ingredients in this game are life forms with faces and hands.<br>
It would be nice if you could take care of them.<br>
<br/>
Hand-holding<br/>
If you connect the hands of ingredients, they are connected and your score will be increased.<br/>
If the ingredients are the same, they can be connected by other means than hands, so think carefully about where to drop them.<br/>
<br/>
■Exchange of pots and pans<br/>
When all the quota ingredients are placed in an earthenware pot, you can "exchange pots" to move to the next level of pots.<br/>
The score is calculated when you exchange pots, so you should pile up as many pots as possible before exchanging pots.<br/>
<br/>
■Skewer<br/>
The ingredients and connected ingredients that have been skewered will be fixed to the pot and will not fall out.<br/>
<br/>
Fever skewer<br/>
Each time you pile up ingredients, the gauge will accumulate and you can use the "Fever Skewer".<br/>
The ingredients that are hit with the "Fever Skewer" will disappear from the pot, so be sure to use it properly.<br/>
<br/>
The game is over when the ingredients fall out of the pot!<br/>
Relax and enjoy the game while looking at the cute ingredients.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Saint Orianne had to call upon all of her power to defeat him, since no one else stood a chance.<br/><br/>Now Loptr has returned, and his first move has already wiped out one of the world's strongest armies. However, it will be some time before he regains his full strength, so his victory is not yet certain.<br/><br/>Sword Princess Sistina is a fairly sheltered young woman, but her combat skills are first class. She sets out on a journey to discover Loptr's weakness and prevent his resurrection, together with her childhood friend Luis and his best friend, Rayne. Luis has the knowledge of a scholar, while Rayne's street smarts are unrivaled.<br/><br/>The three of them will encounter fantastical monsters, religious zealots with their own ideas of how Loptr should be confronted, and other demons who scheme against humanity on their way to fight the Demon God. Through their combined wits and abilities, they must save the Human World or be annihilated by the demons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1551650/extras/Sword_Princess_Sistina_Description_2_EN.png?t=1709010016"><br/>In this RPG, every weapon you obtain will teach you new abilities for use in battle.
