Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body2_2.png?t=1710364055"><br/>In <i>Dune: Imperium</i>, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.<br/><br/>The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Footer.png?t=1710364055"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							Not all wars are fought on the open battlefield. Download The Saboteur to visit 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris, as you play tough Irish racecar mechanic Sean Devlin. Working with the French Resistance, Sean is out for revenge against ruthless Nazi Colonel Kurt Dierker, who executed Sean’s best friend.<br/><br/>This open-world action thriller takes you through the seedy streets of Paris as you seek to undermine the German authority and lead a rebellion. Fight across rooftops and through dangerous alleys, and operate a wide variety of vehicles as you navigate your terrain. You can even climb the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame Cathedral for a sniping mission.<br/><br/>Use stealth and disguise to strike at the heart of the Nazi war machine by disabling trains, destroying bridges, and blowing up enemy facilities. As you work to remove the oppressive forces from parts of the city, the drab black-and-white palette gives way to bright colors, signifying that you’ve inspired the townspeople. The more you incite the people, the more they’ll aid you by intervening in fights or providing a quick getaway from pursuing Germans. The Saboteur presents a fresh take on World War II and features dramatic cinematic elements. The action and intrigue is yours to experience via download on the PC now.<br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>First Ever Open-World Paris</strong> — Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d’Elysee as you sabotage your enemies.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_customisation_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Customize and create your own trial patient.<br/>Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.<br/>Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. <br/>Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_NOAKS.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_barlow.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_doris.jpg?t=1709677975"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INVESTIGATE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_investigate_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. <br/>Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.<br/>The Process:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							An entirely new experience from the makers of the ‘The Forest’<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1326470/extras/VirginiaWaterfall.gif?t=1708624856"><br/><br/>Sent to find a missing billionaire on a remote island, you find yourself in a cannibal-infested hellscape. Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>A Survival Horror Simulator</strong></h2><br/>Experience complete freedom to tackle the world how you want.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							# Immerse yourself in My Sweet Floating in the void!<br/><br/>The Game is a philosophical journey toward the betterment of one's being; it is advancement, evolution and rebirth. The more we advance, facing and overcoming the obstacles in our lives, the more we improve ourselves, subsequently achieving a reward, a satisfaction of being, what is called happiness by many!<br/>Each section consists of a labyrinthine system of arrows and numbers; to unlock each section you will have to follow an arrow path to its finish line (remembering the sequence of numbers on your path) and complete each puzzle through a number pad.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2738740/extras/My_Sweet_Floating_In_The_Void_24p.jpg?t=1710507235"><br/><br/>To advance and move forward, you will also have to discover the meaning of each symbol and color so that you can complete the puzzles and access all areas of the game. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2738740/extras/My_Sweet_Floating_In_The_Void_35p.jpg?t=1710507235"><br/><br/>Get carried away by a new and unique gaming experience for your mind, completely Retro graphics and style, a player control system that is nothing short of unique and equally ingenious, accompanied by extremely strange and difficult Rebuses where not only intellect will be needed to complete them, but also a good memory!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2738740/extras/My_Sweet_Floating_In_The_Void_7p.jpg?t=1710507235"><br/><br/>+ GAME PECULIARITIES +<br/><br/>° The player will always be able to float throughout the game without ever falling below the point where he is suspended, except if he ends up in an area marked by a purple border, in which case he will fall by accessing or in the area below, or by teleporting to the next section.<br/>° It contains a labyrinthine rebus system never seen before, that the player will have to complete to unlock the following areas through the interaction of a particular and bizarre numeric keypad (which will also often be decipherable).<br/>° Graphically, the game is totally made with basic color textures and, within many areas, there are many psychedelic parts to make it decidedly more particular, original and captivating.<br/>° The game contains 6 game worlds, each with its own graphic and artistic theme. As you complete more sections, you will be able to return to previous worlds in order to access newly unlocked areas.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2738740/extras/My_Sweet_Floating_In_The_Void_9p.jpg?t=1710507235"><br/><br/>+ REPRESENTATION OF GAME WORLDS +<br/><br/>White World:<br/>A strange portal that will take you to a new dimension.<br/><br/>Grey world:<br/>The beginning of the mystery or the end of something... a limbo in which you are sometimes without actually being there, that takes us and sends us further, finally leading us inexorably to itself.<br/><br/>Green World:<br/>Inspired by nature, it is definitely the most structurally weird and psychedelic world; it offers more vegetation and color, along with as many puzzles that will engage the player to make the most of their memory to complete all the puzzles and discover all the secrets.<br/><br/>Orange World:<br/>A arid, desert world, where the few central cubic structures (including those outside) are full of charm and mystery. They will lead you on strange paths and offer you extremely difficult puzzles.<br/><br/>Red World:<br/>A part of the game that approaches an artistically oriental theme, with very complex puzzles that can only be completed by looking beyond the traditional logic. It will offer you a slow descent (or fall) towards something that is there, but until the end it keeps us hidden among the green and bright structures of which it is composed, hiding the occult to itself and to everyone.<br/><br/>Blue World:<br/>Cubes that intertwine logic and mystery, broken castles that offer a new vision of their path and that, thanks to the snow, offer cold and dispersive puzzles, where the common logic will not be enough to complete them, but also a real change of perspective.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2738740/extras/My_Sweet_Floating_In_The_Void_36p.jpg?t=1710507235"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Curiosity. Exploration. The opening of the mind, through the process of discovery and revelation. Through whatever means you have found yourself here,  you are welcomed, encouraged, to stay.<br/><br/>By finding this, you have self-selected for a rare program intended to test you. In the course of this examination, you will encounter questions and scenarios designed to open your mind to new possibilities and perspectives. Will you heed the call, and explore what potential may yet await you?<br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>This is my first ever game, so hello. This game is a love letter to the era of Flash horror, which I used to indulge in heavily. This is, however, not a horror experience. Instead, it is what I shall call "Bizarre" - taking from another medium, a "Bizarre" work is one that implicates a wider world of magic and ritual. It is often, but not necessarily, presented in a dark and atmospheric manner, with a particular focus on narrative and mystery. I repeat: this is not a conventional horror experience. There are no jumpscares, there are no creatures, there is no survival or opposition, and you are free - and encouraged - to explore as you like.<br/><br/>Here's a rough idea of what you're up for:<br/><br/><strong><u>GRAPHICS</u></strong><br/><br/>This experience is largely text-based, but it uses graphics throughout. Animated backgrounds are present throughout, and art is a central part of the experience at several points throughout. All art, static and animation, is hand-drawn, with a stylistic emphasis on muted tones, typically grayscale, and a sketchy or blotty appearance.<br/><br/><strong><u>GAMEPLAY</u></strong><br/><br/>Gameplay consists largely of point-and-click, particularly in a question-and-answer format. There are some typing sections as well. I made this on Ren.py, a visual novel engine, and brute forced it into being more interactive. At several points, you will be asked to take a critical eye to what you are being presented with. Your success or failure in doing so, and the answers you provide, will lead to one of about 60 permutations of ending. Most of the gameplay will remain the same, although it will occasionally remark on your actions.<br/><br/>Skipping through chunks of dialogue, the game can still take an hour to finish. While you can make it run faster, I wouldn't recommend it. The replay value at launch consists of achieving different endings, including the 'ideal' one, and exploring different choices and what the game might react to. If this is not the sort of game you enjoy, I welcome you to try, but cannot advise you to expect something radically different.<br/><br/><strong><u>REQUIREMENTS</u></strong><br/><br/>This game was developed on Ren.py 7.4.11.2266, and should be compatible with most OS platforms of relatively decent modernity. As the game is largely point and click mechanics with premade art, it does not render much, and should be able to run fine on even low-performance computers. Renpy's release for 7.4 states that OpenGL 2, DirectX 9, OpenGL ES 2, or WebGL are required to run programs on that version, if any clarification is needed.<br/><br/><strong><u><br/>ACCESSIBILITY</u></strong><br/><br/>This game's graphics are predominantly in grayscale, featuring white text on dark black and gray backgrounds. At times, it will use purple text instead. At other times, there will be muted red and black on a gray background. So long as you are capable of distinguishing some color from no color at all, the game will be functional for you. While recent Renpy builds have included a self-voicing feature by default, the visual component of this experience is important, and having eyesight is necessary to progress certain sections.						</div></div>]]></description>

The war left him not only with physical wounds, but also with the invisible scars of PTSD. Despite his bravery on the battlefield, Thomas returned home only to find himself battling a different enemy:<strong> addiction</strong>. This addiction took a toll on his marriage, eventually leading to its dissolution, and plunged him into a spiral of homelessness.<br/><br/>In <strong>1949</strong>, a glimmer of hope emerged when Thomas's grandparents took him in and helped him achieve sobriety. For a brief period, life seemed to regain some semblance of normalcy. However, this fragile peace was shattered when Thomas woke up one morning to find his grandmother accusing him of stealing her medication. Despite his protestations of innocence, suspicion tainted the air.<br/><br/>That fateful night, Thomas awoke in his grandmother's room, surrounded by a pool of blood, with no memory of what had transpired. His grandmother was nowhere to be found, and Thomas was haunted by the terrifying possibility that his PTSD and addiction had driven him to commit a heinous act.<br/><br/>Consumed by guilt, confusion, and fear, Thomas went into hiding, cutting himself off from the world for over a decade. Now, after twelve long years of self-imposed exile, he returns, determined to unravel the mystery of that fateful night and to seek closure, if any can be found. With a tumultuous past weighing heavily on his shoulders, Thomas embarks on a journey of self-discovery, confronting demons both internal and external as he seeks answers and redemption.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2852930/extras/Steam_Gif_2.gif?t=1710520169"><br/><br/><i><strong>Gameplay</strong></i>:<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Immersive Exploration</u></strong>**: Dive into a meticulously crafted, eerie house, where every corner holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Compelling Mystery</u></strong>**: Piece together the events of a tragic night by gathering clues scattered throughout the environment.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Terrifying Atmosphere</u></strong>**: Experience spine-chilling moments as you navigate through an environment filled with unexplainable phenomena and unsettling sound design.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Interactive Horror</u></strong>**: Engage with the environment and trigger paranormal events, blurring the lines between reality and the supernatural.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Mind-Bending Puzzles</u></strong>**: Test your wits with challenging puzzles that require keen observation to solve.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Psychological Tension</u></strong>**: Encounter psychological horror elements that will keep you on the edge of your seat, questioning your own sanity.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Rich Narrative</u></strong>**: Unravel a captivating storyline through environmental storytelling and discovered documents, immersing yourself in the haunting narrative.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Replayability</u></strong>**: Explore branching pathways and discover different endings.<br/><br/>**<strong><u>Unforgettable Horror</u></strong>**: Brace yourself for an unforgettable horror experience, filled with suspense, dread, and moments that will stay with you long after the game ends.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2852930/extras/Steam_Gif_1.gif?t=1710520169"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a VR trip into the ancient world – playing Kottabos, the all-time favorite Greek party game. All the items you see around you are 3D reconstructions of actual ancient furniture, pottery, and Kottabos targets from museums. This historical game is harder than it looks! <br/><br/>In ancient Greece Kottabos was a popular party game in which players threw the dregs from the bottom of their cup at targets. These included a disk on the top of a pole and cups floating in a bowl of water. They competed for adoration, praise, and respect of the other party-goers.<br/><br/>Prove your skill by throwing the dregs of wine from your cup at the metal disk on the pole in front of you, or fling your drops at the little cups floating in a bowl. If the disk or the cups go down, your luck goes up! A round of applause, an extra dessert, or the favor of Aphrodite herself will come to the winners.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Physics-driven gameplay in VR.<br/></li><li>Controller momentum and trigger button throws the dregs.<br/></li><li>Aim at the different targets, and get higher scores based on strength of hit and placement on the target.<br/></li><li>Three different levels of gameplay.<br/></li><li>Tutorial level.<br/></li><li>Track your high scores.<br/></li><li>Educational! Learn about Kottabos, the real Greek party game.<br/></li><li>Free!

Despite the hiccups that naturally occur when a quiet librarian and an internationally famous music producer collide, they hit it off and eventually decide to meet up. The moment Rai takes off the futuristic helmet he’s known for always wearing, he reveals to Francis his biggest secret: he is actually a Dullahan, a mythical being who has no head.<br/><br/>While lugging around her own emotional baggage, can Francis make a relationship work with this nice young man who also happens to be a headless pop star?</i><br/><br/>- - -<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over 140,000 words<br/></li><li>9 different endings<br/></li><li>A heavily electronic, hip-hop soundtrack<br/></li><li>3 very cute cats — as you progress, unlock special scenes from the cats' POV<br/></li><li>the majority of the most emotionally charged scenes occur at Waffle House</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Please Take Note:</h2><i>the head well lost</i> is a commercial otome game with one character route that takes place over the course of about a year. Francis and Rai start dating fairly early on in the game. Thus, the maintenance of the relationship is the main point, not the pursuit.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of Rai's job, he and Francis are not always together. This is especially true for about the first half of the game. As a result, a good chunk of the story occurs through <strong>text messages</strong> and <strong>phone calls</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Content warnings:</strong> There are a handful of fade-to-black, text-only references to consensual sex. There are also textual depictions of legal alcohol consumption and some violence.						</img></div></div>]]></description>
