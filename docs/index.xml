      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">A lively parade with hololive VTubers and mascot characters!</h2><br/>"HoloParade" is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for "holo Indie". Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It's a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.<br/><br/>What is "holo Indie"?:<br/>It is a general term for a game brand for derivative work games, produced using the "game creator support program" with the aim of co-creating with fans and creators of hololive Production around the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 1: Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</h2>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy's base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's an element inspired by parades called the 'Symphony Effect,' where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Battle.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 2: Comprehensive Development Elements</h2>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a 'Skill' system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Skill_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 3: No Gacha Purchases, No Stamina System</h2>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.<br/><br/>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Gacha_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 4: Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</h2>When you return to the office, the home screen, you'll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Home_ENG.png?t=1701417555"><br/><br/>Additionally, mini-games with entirely different gameplay from the main story are implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. At the initial release, a mini-game titled "Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!" is available, where Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with hololive) who overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles. More mini-games are planned to be added in future updates.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/RunMikoti.gif?t=1701417555"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>‚ÄúAll is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come‚Äù, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape‚Äôs audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. ‚ÄúTime ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles‚Ä¶ but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh‚Äîdon‚Äôt come too close, you don‚Äôt want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?‚Äù The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. ‚ÄúAh, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots ‚Äì what could all this mean?‚Äù<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1701355158"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures‚Äô needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that <strong>your Dungeon is well-secured</strong> by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won‚Äôt just twiddle their thumbs while you <strong>turn their land into the Absolute Evil‚Äôs most pleasurable holiday paradise</strong>.<br/><br/>But what is that noise? <i>‚ÄúGold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!‚Äù</i> The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. <strong>The Dwarves have arrived</strong> to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon‚Äôs heart.<br/><br/>Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now <strong>bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness‚Ñ¢</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-1_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Everything is better with Dwarves‚Ñ¢:</strong> The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don‚Äôt like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-2_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>It makes your Dungeon great again:</strong> Dungeons are up to four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil‚Äôs orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-3_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Ripe for the taking:</strong> The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-4_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>New and shiny:</strong> An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil‚Äôs trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-5_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Minions, everywhere:</strong> The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil‚Äôs bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil‚Äôs orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-6_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Many ways to tell the story:</strong> A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-7_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Change the world:</strong> Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-8_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Work together, slay together:</strong> 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody‚Äôs favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Meta Card 2 is now available on Steam</h2>The world's first card + survivor + tower defense<br/>Control two characters at the same time, play cards, play Qiuqiu, innovative experience, no replacement in the entire network!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880160/extras/ÁÆÄ‰∏≠-Âê∏ÂäõÈæôÂç∑È£é.gif?t=1701592811"><br/>Click the link below to add it to your wish list!<br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669440/2__MetaCard2" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669440/2__MetaCard2</a><h2 class="bb_tag">Building cards that can control two characters</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880160/extras/ÂáªÊùÄÂä†ÁªìÁÆó2ÂÄçÈÄüGIFÊ†ºÂºè.gif?t=1701592811"><br/>The world's first construction card game that can simultaneously control two characters with independent decks.<h2 class="bb_tag">A different role system at the bottom</h2><br/>Based on the underlying setting of "Slaying the Spire", fans of "Slaying the Spire" subjectively feel that the characters in "Slaying the Spire" have different card libraries and initial relics, and there is no difference in the bottom layer.<br/><br/>Even each character uses armor as a means of defense, and each character gets a fixed fee every round.<br/><br/>So on this basis, this product is based on the design concept that the bottom layer of each character is different.<br/><br/>Of course, in order for players to get started quickly, the underlying logic of the first character fighter is the same as that of "Slaying the Spire".<br/><br/>But the second character mage is different. The mage has an initial 99 mana points, but it will only be full at the beginning of the chapter.<br/><br/>So in the rest of the time, you need to rely on cards and artifacts to recover blue, which is a role that pays more attention to long-term operations.<br/><br/>And the mage also has the special entry of casting spells, the details can be experienced in the game.<br/><br/>The third character, Voidwalker, is the first character in the world to add real-time combat elements to an original turn-based game, because the energy of Voidwalker is time.<br/><br/>Therefore, each round has an initial time of 25 seconds. When the time passes naturally, the round will automatically end.<br/><br/>And the player needs to make a strategic judgment within 25 seconds and use your cards.<br/><br/>Note: The cost consumed by your card is also time!<br/><br/>And Voidwalker has a special card that can be used in the enemy's turn, and can use [Time and Space Guardian] at the moment of the enemy's attack, so as to achieve an effect similar to that of a knife.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don't like this genre that tests reaction and operation, you can also try the unique hang-up flow of Voidwalker, and you can achieve output and recovery by standing still.<h2 class="bb_tag">Continuous update</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880160/extras/Âõõ‰∏™ÁâàÊú¨Ëø≠‰ª£2ÂÄçÈÄüGIFÊ†ºÂºè.gif?t=1701592811"><br/>Although it is only a product made by one person, I have been insisting on updating it.<br/>The current version has almost no BUG, and the overall trend is stable. At the request of fans, steam achievements and cloud saves have been implemented.<br/>In terms of content, there are currently 28 general-purpose artifacts, 30 warrior-specific artifacts, 24 mage-specific artifacts, and 20 voidwalker-specific artifacts.<br/>There are 82 cards for fighters, 66 cards for mages, and 41 cards for voidwalkers.<br/>Moreover, a lot of special effects have been added to the cards and BUFF, and you are welcome to experience it in the game.<br/>If you have any feedback, you can also comment and leave a message. Your praise is my greatest encouragement.<br/>Follow-up will be the development of the summoning style of the Voidwalker. If you have good ideas, please leave a comment~						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Discover Gaming Liberation with Creative Continents Phase III: A New Frontier in Player Empowerment<br>
<br>
Greetings, fellow adventurers and visionaries of the gaming realm! We stand at the threshold of a new era in gaming ‚Äì an era where your creative impulses take center stage. Welcome to the latest evolution of Creative Continents, where the journey towards true gaming freedom begins.<br>
<br>
When I embarked on the Creative Continents journey, I envisioned more than just a game. I saw a platform that would give players the ability to sculpt their own realms, craft personalized maps, and forge unforgettable experiences with friends. Today, I am thrilled to present a world where this vision has started to become reality, offering you an opportunity like no other.<br>
<br>
Picture this: you have the power to shape the very land beneath your feet, to cultivate a landscape that resonates with your imagination. With a diverse palette of 50 land types and an array of vibrant foliage at your fingertips, your creative expressions know no bounds. But the journey doesn't halt at creation; it's an invitation to immerse yourself in a vivid third-person perspective and explore the fruits of your labor.<br>
<br/>
This experience is far from solitary. Through seamless integration with Steam Multiplayer, your friends can join you on your journey, coexisting in the world you've sculpted. In Creative Continents, the traditional barriers between developer and player dissolve. The narrative is yours to weave, and the destiny of your world lies in your capable hands.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the development of this experience, my goal has been profound: Can we, as creators, relinquish control and hand the reins of power over to you, the players? Can we pave the way for an experience where you are not just gamers, but architects of your own digital destinies?<br/>
<br/>
Together, we venture into uncharted territory, a realm where creative freedom isn't a promise but a reality. Creative Continents is more than a game; it's a testament to your ingenuity, your aspirations, and your ability to reshape the landscape of gaming itself.<br/>
<br/>
Together, let's uncover the true essence of player empowerment.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The civilized world is no more, with only a horde of robots called Ancients roaming everywhere. The world is now only war and about is a battlefield. Alice is a mechanic who finds a malfunctioning tank AI on the battlefield. She repairs the AI, and together with AI, begins a journey to traverse the land of the Ancients, reaching the mythical end of the world!<br>
How to play:<br>
           -    Control the vehicle on the battlefield, find and reach the green-marked locations to move to the next map.<br>
-    In addition to the main mission, you also have a secondary mission on each map. It could be finding certain resources, escaping the battlefield within a set time, destroying designated targets, or destroying powerful Ancients of the enemy... Each map is a new experience!<br>
-    Destroy all Bunkers and ancients blocking your way!<br>
-    Collect resources, Fusion Core, Plasma Battery, and Nano Iron to upgrade and craft more weapons.<br>
-    Craft various gun towers: Novar, Plasma... for your vehicle!<br>
-    Equip additional weapons: Boom Plasma, Ground Mine, and Missile to destroy Ancients on the battlefield.<br/>
-    And, of course, upgrade your vehicle even stronger with many different upgrade paths!<br/>
-    Many enemy Ancients on the battlefield with different strengths that you must be careful to defeat.<br/>
-    Maps full of challenges, every enemy is very dangerous!<br/>
-    Simple and intuitive controls, move in four basic directions, and gun towers will move in the direction of your movement. If Ancients are nearby, your gun tower will automatically target them.<br/>
-    Shoot and switch weapons flexibly to destroy enemy Ancients, and make use of the items you've collected to repair your vehicle right on the battlefield.<br/>
-    You can start a new game as many times as you like, and all your resources, achievements, and upgrades will be reset!<br/>
<br/>
We hope "Alice and The Ancients" will give you a new experience, fill your leisure time, and help you have a pleasant time! Thank you for reading the introduction to "Alice and The Ancients!"						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
