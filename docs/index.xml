If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Take life by the horns in Goat Simulator 3 today!<br/><br/>Gather your herd and venture forth into Goat Simulator 3; an all-new*, totally realistic**, sandbox farmyard*** experience that puts you back in the hooves of no one's favourite female protagonist.<br/><br/>Join Pilgor and get ready to create your own whirlwind adventure on the island of San Angora. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through our open world in the biggest waste of your time since the original Goat Simulator! We won't tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/AnnouncementTrailer_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>If your dreams contain more than one goat, that works for us! In Goat Simulator 3, you can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op to create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. And don't worry, there are plenty of customisation options so you and your pals don't wear clashing outfits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Customization_Minigames_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>Goat Simulator 3 first launched in November 2022, and since then our “game designers” have been hard at work adding even more weird and wondrous stuff. As well as all the original goat-y goodness, Steam players will be able to experience all content from the game’s post-launch updates; including the Mandatory Holiday Update, Operation Crackdown and the Shadiest Update, with more to come!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Steam_Promo_Image_Group_Shot_757.png?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/>- You can be a goat<br/>- You can be a goat… on Steam!<br/>- Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op<br/>- No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There's a goat for everyone!<br/>- Dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care<br/>- We have actual 'game designers' who have worked to create 'an okay amount of content'; including events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak<br/>- They've added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?)<br/>- They’ve even added a bunch of extra content since the game first launched, aren’t you a bunch of lucky kids?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Gameplay_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br/>Since it launched in November 2022, Goat Simulator 3 has been a completely stupid game. It is still a completely stupid game today, except now it has more stuff! By this point if you're not sure what you're getting into, we can't help you.<br/><br/><strong>NOTES:</strong><br/>* Goat Simulator 3 is technically not completely new, but it is new to Steam users!<br/>** Our game is very realistic, if you happen to be a digital goat with a proclivity for ragdolling.<br/>*** False alarm, this one is actually true.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You are to revive your "empire" and become small, yet great, once again.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1486140/extras/1all_2.gif?t=1709384449"><br/><br/>A relaxing strategy game featuring unconventional gameplay.

Everything is fully real-time. Opponents capture more land area, compete with each other, extract resources and develop said areas.<br/><br/>Environment:<br/>All locations have particular environmental conditions. Organisms may freeze or overheat. They may mutate due to radiation and receive bonuses.<br/>Acclimatize your organisms to certain environmental conditions in the incubator.<br/>You are able to terraform your lands, creating extreme environments - beneficial to your organisms, yet deadly to your opponents. <br/><br/>Extract resources, erect "buildings", capture and defend land areas on the global map.<br/><br/>You can also feed your organisms, much like fish:)<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1486140/extras/en-UNIQUENESS.png?t=1709384449"><br/>Uniqueness and Project Concept:<br/>Microcosmum 2 was conceived as a unique game, unlike any other strategy game, capable of surprising with new ideas. The emphasis is on creating a deep atmosphere, meditative gameplay, and a pleasant visual style. The goal is for the player to immerse themselves in the atmosphere and relax during the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1486140/extras/en-AUTHORS.png?t=1709384449"><br/>Microcosmum 2 was created by a team of two people. For five years, we spared no effort, time, or resources in creating the game. For us, Microcosmum is not just a game; it's a unique world created by us with its own character and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Microcosmum: Survival of Cells was our first successful game. It became beloved by a large number of players and continues to be popular to this day. Therefore, in Microcosmum 2, we invested all our strength and accumulated experience to make it much better and bring joy to everyone who has been eagerly awaiting the second part, as well as to be a discovery for those who are just getting acquainted with Microcosmum.<br/><br/>Enjoy the game! :)						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Ace Pilot Pacific</h2> is my 3rd game and I have been working on it for around a year and a half. The action takes place during World War 2 in the Pacific.<br/><br/>You will fly one of the six different aircraft available against the Japanese.<br/>You will be dog fighting against Zeros, Ki43, Ki49, G4M, G4M2, Hk8K2, Nakajima Kikka, J8M Shusui, and Shinden.<br/><br/>Choose between 5 missions:<br/>- Atoll<br/>- Pearl Harbor<br/>- Wake Island<br/>- Japan Run<br/>- Ha Long Bay<br/><br/>You can play them in the order you want without restriction. The goal is to obtain the highest score in every mission. When you or one of your Allies destroys a plane, you gain a flag. When you have 3 flags, you gain an Ace level. The mission ends at Ace 100, if you are still alive. When you destroy an enemy, you get a Power UP, at Ace 100 you get an Upgrade.<br/><br/>All missions start with you and a wingman against 3 Japanese and when you gain an Ace Level, the number of enemies increase as well as the number of Allies, but the numbers are random, sometimes you get more Allies, sometimes it's the opposite.<br/><br/>Backgrounds are very detailed all in 4K HD. Atoll is a small map, Wake Island is a giant one 32768x30720 pixels. The effect is stunning and if you're like me, you will want to go swimming on that beach.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2246530/extras/F4U_x1_1.gif?t=1709359014"><br/>All the objects are 3D, even the sea. <br/>I recommend you use a game controller. It's like flying a small RC aircraft on your screen. But it also works with a keyboard.<br/><br/>I am planning to add more missions if the reviews are good. If you like it, give it a thumbs up.<br/>Hubert						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<br>
Your journey unfolds with a series of comical encounters, starting with facing off against the first enemy amidst a backdrop of amusing cat pictures. Soon, you find yourself navigating through a treacherous dungeon, where you must employ your wits to locate a crucial key. However, your task is interrupted by the sudden appearance of a colossal meatball, which ominously warns you to flee. Despite the threat, the meatball reveals a surprising kindness, allowing you to escape unscathed.<br>
<br>
With the key in hand, you unlock the path to the final showdown—a climactic battle where you transform into the BUFF cat, brimming with muscles and determination. In a fierce clash against formidable adversaries, you unleash the full might of your cucumber prowess, emerging victorious as the revered Cucumber Champion.<br/>

There is over a million different ways to play if you fiddle with the settings.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gamemodes</h2>There are two different game modes <strong>arcade</strong> and <strong>frenzy</strong>. The difference between them is the frequency of certain blocks that fall. In <strong>frenzy</strong> the lower the number on the block the more of that block will be on the board, allowing you to combo more easily with it, but at the expense of points since lower blocks will fall more often. In <strong>arcade</strong> the blocks that fall are completely randomized.<h2 class="bb_tag">Settings</h2>You can alter the settings of the board within the settings menu. The music volume, amount of rows and columns, the amount of seconds it takes for a new row of coins to drop in a game, and the spawn rate of power blocks are all editable within this menu. <br/><br/><strong>Here are the possible applicable settings</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Music: 0%-100%<br/></li><li> Rows: 5-50<br/></li><li> Columns: 5-50<br/></li><li> Seconds till fall: 1-60<br/></li><li> Power Block Spawn Rate: 0%-10%</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Scoreboard Info</h2>The game has a local scoreboard that keeps track of your top 5 scores.
