<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of one of the three adventurers: youthful French aristocrat, a formidable Spanish mercenary, or a savvy English entrepreneur. Explore, trade, plunder, complete quests and enjoy the Caribbean Open World. This game has the most of improvements and a good portion of new content from the upcoming Caribbean Legend. <strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/steamchar2.jpg?t=1707850966"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имени-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The Caribbean is your domain, offering everything from exploring ancient pyramids to capturing entire towns.<br/></li><li><strong>Hundred Recurring Quests</strong>: Engage in a myriad of quests, each with multiple potential outcomes, including freight jobs, bounty hunting, trading contracts, and more!<br/></li><li><strong>Unique Quests:</strong> Embark on twenty distinctive quests, each with its own compelling narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Land and Naval Warfare</strong>: Transition from confronting thugs in jungles and pirating a small game to leading full-scale sieges and commanding an armada of warships.<br/></li><li><strong>Extensive Customisation</strong>: Tailor your experience with character builds, dozens of ships, and a vast array of over a hundred items and weapons.<br/></li><li><strong>Side Activities</strong>: Immerse yourself in a wide range of activities, including crafting, trading, duels, gambling, smuggling, romance, ship upgrading, and treasure hunting.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имениdd-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/>Caribbean Legend: Sandbox is at the beginning of its journey as we aim to create the ultimate pirate freeplay game. This game is still under development, and while we haven't finalized all the main future milestones, our general vision is already taking shape. The old Sea Dogs approach primarily focused on expanding quest content. When a player completed all available side quests, their journey in the game would come to an end. This approach wasn't necessarily flawed, but we're excited to explore a new direction. <br/><br/>What if the game consistently generated one-of-a-kind situations for players, ensuring each playthrough remains captivating and distinctive, from the early game to the very end? Let's discover the possibilities! Based on sales of the full game and community feedback, the following roadmap may undergo adjustments, to the lesser or (hopefully!) the bigger scale. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/en-roadmap.png?t=1707850966"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">About</h2>Following "Trajectory of summer flower", the official production team SoraPrayer brings you the authentic sequel. This story unfolds ten years after the events of the previous installment. Unlike the portrayal of rural feudalistic customs from an urbanite's perspective in the previous work, this installment takes a different approach. It follows a youth, native to Tangxia Village, providing a perspective rooted in indigenous culture to depict the hidden feudalistic darkness and customs within Chinese villages more profoundly. Additionally, this installment emphasizes the theme of "family", and the humorous and comedic daily life elements from the previous work are preserved authentically, ensuring that you will not find this realistic and poignant subject matter dull. The protagonists and related characters from the previous work will also play crucial roles in this installment, interacting with the new main character, offering you a fresh perspective on the beautiful love story among the youths in the summer countryside.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Little is known about Tangxia Village, a secluded small mountain village. The scenery here is picturesque, with a perpetual summer-like atmosphere throughout the seasons. For most people, it is like a utopia, but beneath this beauty, this village is rife with feudalistic customs incongruent with its idyllic surroundings. Human trafficking, gender bias, and archaic rituals such as ghost marriage persist in the village, remnants of the old society's customs.<br/>The protagonist of the story, Ma Xiaodong, is the son of the Ma family, local landlords in this village. Living with his father, Ma Qingchen, his two sisters, Ma Minyi and Ma Wenhui, and his childhood friend, Zhu Qianyin, the five of them share a household. As the eldest son, Ma Xiaodong cherishes every day spent with his family, valuing them above all else.  Though his father occasionally treats him harshly, he remains committed to the principle of filial piety. <br/>Despite the seemingly peaceful surface, the inevitable conflict between personal growth and traditional beliefs creates tensions. Like a butterfly breaking free from its cocoon, changes in thoughts and contradictions with traditional values become apparent one summer. In this particular summer, long-hidden family secrets gradually surface. Faced with the impending darkness, the choices between change and tradition, how will the young boys and girls respond? Will the gears of their destiny begin to turn, propelling them towards new horizons? All the answers will be revealed in this summer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Character Introductions</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2698190/extras/intro_1.png?t=1707876052"><br/><strong>Zhu Qianyin</strong><br/>Character Voice: 桂圆翊宝<br/>BWH: 82/58/84<br/>Birthday: December 5<br/>Height: 156cm<br/>Weight: 43kg<br/>Of unknown origin, Zhu Qianyin has lived in the Ma family since childhood and is Ma Xiaodong's childhood friend.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of one of the three adventurers: youthful French aristocrat, a formidable Spanish mercenary, or a savvy English entrepreneur. Explore, trade, plunder, complete quests and enjoy the Caribbean Open World. This game has the most of improvements and a good portion of new content from the upcoming Caribbean Legend. <strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/steamchar2.jpg?t=1707850966"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имени-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The Caribbean is your domain, offering everything from exploring ancient pyramids to capturing entire towns.<br/></li><li><strong>Hundred Recurring Quests</strong>: Engage in a myriad of quests, each with multiple potential outcomes, including freight jobs, bounty hunting, trading contracts, and more!<br/></li><li><strong>Unique Quests:</strong> Embark on twenty distinctive quests, each with its own compelling narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Land and Naval Warfare</strong>: Transition from confronting thugs in jungles and pirating a small game to leading full-scale sieges and commanding an armada of warships.<br/></li><li><strong>Extensive Customisation</strong>: Tailor your experience with character builds, dozens of ships, and a vast array of over a hundred items and weapons.<br/></li><li><strong>Side Activities</strong>: Immerse yourself in a wide range of activities, including crafting, trading, duels, gambling, smuggling, romance, ship upgrading, and treasure hunting.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имениdd-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/>Caribbean Legend: Sandbox is at the beginning of its journey as we aim to create the ultimate pirate freeplay game. This game is still under development, and while we haven't finalized all the main future milestones, our general vision is already taking shape. The old Sea Dogs approach primarily focused on expanding quest content. When a player completed all available side quests, their journey in the game would come to an end. This approach wasn't necessarily flawed, but we're excited to explore a new direction. <br/><br/>What if the game consistently generated one-of-a-kind situations for players, ensuring each playthrough remains captivating and distinctive, from the early game to the very end? Let's discover the possibilities! Based on sales of the full game and community feedback, the following roadmap may undergo adjustments, to the lesser or (hopefully!) the bigger scale. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/en-roadmap.png?t=1707850966"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Be the hero the world needs in such a desperate time. A meteorite crashes into Earth, leaving a dangerous amount of radiation that engulfs a huge area of a city, horribly mutating humans and exposing them to lethal levels of radiation. Alongside the meteor, unknown celestial aliens arrive with plans unknown for the planet and a powerful yet dangerous substance known as celestial ore. This resource has many different properties depending on the human it reaches. It can be radioactive to lethal levels, transforming humans into raging, nearly mindless mutants aggressively and aimlessly fighting without end. In special cases, a few humans are mutated, granting them special abilities at random. These abilities can vary from lightning and super strength to super regeneration, fire, or anything else based on random mutations from person to person.<br/><br/>You fight against many powerful bosses and formidable foes willing to do anything to get their hands on celestial ore, to stop them from using it for their own evil purposes. On top of all that lies the bigger problem at hand: what exactly came down to Earth inside the meteor, what it is, and what will happen to the planet if it's not handled in time. It all depends on you as the last hope to save the world!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong> <br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"> <li>Fight Powerful bosses.<br/><br/></li><li>Gain New Abilities.<br/><br/></li><li>Find New Weapons.</li></ul><br/>Trailer Music from - Symphonic_Metal_Music_For_Games by Intersonic Sound - Music - Aug 16, 2023						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Several days have passed since James collapsed due to an unknown illness. His lover, Wendy, visited his hospital room every day, but there were no signs of improvement in James's condition. One day, exhausted Wendy woke up not in her room but in a room with a mystical fairy sitting before her. The fairy's name was Tinker Bell, who claimed to have come from Neverland.<br>
<br>
Neverland faces the brink of destruction due to the machinations of Captain Hook, resurrected after 100 years. To reclaim the tainted Fairy Spring from Captain Hook, Tinker Bell, along with Neverland's legendary hero, Peter Pan, had crafted a plan, but Wendy's assistance was essential for its success. Legend has it that Wendy's great-grandmother once adventured in Neverland with Peter Pan and defeated Captain Hook.<br>
<br>
Tinker Bell convinced Wendy that reclaiming the Fairy Spring would restore her powers and also awaken James. Moved by her words, Wendy decided to embark on a journey to Neverland.<br>
<br>
In this game, players take on the role of Wendy, embarking on a mystical adventure in Neverland to thwart Captain Hook's schemes and recover the Fairy Spring. It's a quest to save her loved one and change the fate of Neverland, marking the beginning of Wendy's new adventure.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Monster Scout is a soccer game with a focus on scouting. You become a coach in the world of monster soccer, going on reconnaissance missions and scouting monsters.<br>

<br>
The fate of your team depends on your discerning eye! Find strong players and scout them for your team!<br>
<br>
Players have various personalities, such as being fast runners, being good at passing, or being skilled at dribbling. However, you can't see these statuses as numerical values.

<br/>
During the match, the players move on their own. All you can do is coach, such as arranging players and swapping them with the bench. Be sure to enjoy the realistic feeling of being a coach!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>A Game About Flicking A Switch</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2672850/A_Game_About_Flicking_A_Switch/?snr=1_239_new__tab-AllNewReleases</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2672850/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is LITERALLY just a game about flicking a switch. It's in the title. You, in a room, four pale-green colored walls, stained carpet, and those funky ceiling tiles you definitely imagined punching out when you were a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking for groundbreaking mechanics? There's one function in the game - you flick a switch.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe award-winning graphics? Well, it is Unreal Engine 5. But let's be honest here, the engine is not in the slightest sense utilized to its highest ability in this game.<br/>
<br/>
How about immersive story-driven gameplay? Nope. Not here. Unless you consider the story of you really reconciling with the fact you spent money to flick a virtual switch, when you and I both know you are most likely sitting in a room right now that has a few switches scattered around the walls. Have fun staring at your bank account later, wondering where it all went wrong as you dove helplessly into the immersive world of a 9x9x9 room with ONE SWITCH ON THE WALL FOR YOU TO INTERACT WITH.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, let's jump ahead to the key features:<br/>
<br/>
There are none.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how you judge the "ending" of a game, or how you would quantify your sense of sanity in terms of time spent playing a game where you do absolutely nothing but stand in a single room flicking a single switch as time around you ticks on; endlessly disregarding any sense of desperation for it to slow down so that you may bask in the sanctity of joy for even a brief moment, until hopefully the power cuts out, or someone comes to your aide to end this troubling sense of self infliction -- It should take you around 1 - 30 minutes to complete the game.<br/>
<br/>
Buy it, don't buy it. Totally your decision. This game will not keep you up at night, nor will it have you beckoning for more; but if for some reason it does butter your cups, douse your daisies in oil, or roll your drums, then I may consider you take some time away from gaming for a short period, or maybe the whole period.<br/>
<br/>
I do not, in any sense of lacking the word, hope that you do not find, to any extent, any sense of enjoyment from this game.<br/>
<br/>
Final note: The selected reviews above are totally not from ChatGPT. They are real, and so are the names of those who wrote them.						</div></div>]]></description>
