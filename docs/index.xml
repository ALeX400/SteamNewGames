<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">THIS IS A MATH GAME</h2><br/>All you do in this game is solve math problems.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INCREDIBLY DARK AND DISTURBING DESCRIPTIONS OF VIOLENCE</strong></h2><br/>WARNING!!!<br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer is incredibly dark and disturbing. You must listen to recordings made by the Serial Killer. These recordings describe violence against men, women, and children.  Only the most courageous Special Agents should attempt to enter the dungeons of the Math Problem Killer.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ENTER DISTUBRING DUNGEONS AND SOLVE THE KILLER'S CREEPY MATH</strong></h2><br/>The main gameplay mechanic of The Math Problem Killer is walking through dungeons and listening to the recordings of a sadistic serial killer recount how he stalked, abducted and tortured his victims., and ultimately solving a math problem based on those disturbing stories.  The ultimate goal of each level is to rescue an individual hostage that his being held at the end of the dungeon.  <br/><br/>As you walk through the dungeons, the killer will tell you stories about how he abducted or tortured a victim. In his stories there will be facts, such as when he abducted a victim, or how long he followed them, or how long he tortured them, or how long it took them to die.  He will then form a math question based on the facts from his stories.  Such as...<br/><br/><strong><i></i>"I want you to start with Andrea's age, then multiply that by the number of nails I hammered into her husband. Then add the number of minutes I made her hang in my dungeon. Then multiply this number by the number of minutes I tortured Andrea's neighbor."<i></i> </strong><br/><br/>You will need to listen to all of the recordings in the room in order to gather all of the information required to solve the question.  When you do have your answer, you must enter it into the keypad on the door to the next room. If your answer is correct, the door will open and you will repeat the process until you reach the last room with the hostage. If your answer is wrong, then the hostage dies immediately and you must start over. <br/><br/>At its core, The Math Problem Killer is a tense, slow paced, story centric, crime thriller, walking simulator.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>A CRIME THRILLER STORY</strong></h2><br/>The Math Problem Killer is a crime thriller. A sadistic serial killer, known as the Math Problem killer has been murdering people in the city of New Columbia. At the request of the mayor and state governor, a federal Serial Killer Task Force arrives to hunt down the Serial Killer. Within days of arrival, the Task Force recieves a communication from the illusive and dangerous killer.  He has taken a hostage named Bethany Morgan. He tells the Task Force the hostage location, but he also informs the task force that they may only send one agent inside, and that agent may not have any communication with the outside world. <br/><br/>You are the Task Force Special Agent that is chosen to enter the facility and attempt a rescue of Bethany Morgan. The game takes place over the course of 11 weeks, and follows the Serial Killer Task Force as it attempts to find and apprehend the Math Problem killer. Each week is a new dungeon that must be entered, and a new hostage that must be rescued.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/hanging_nails.gif?t=1708346357"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>THE KILLER WILL TELL YOU DISTURBING STORIES</strong></h2><br/>The Math Problem Killer is a sadistic and violent monster. He enjoys stalking, and torturing his victims. He also enjoys bragging about his exploits even more. Throughout each dungeon you will find recordings left by the killer. In each recording, he will recount with delight the various methods he employed to capture and torture his victims. You must be prepared to listen to unsettling and disturbing accountings of murder and violence towards, men, women and children. But remember, you are a special agent in the Serial Killer Task Force, and it is your job to rescue the hostage being held in the dungeons. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/keypad.gif?t=1708346357"><br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer has placed multiple recordings of pieces of a fact pattern and an accompanying complicated multi-part word problem in each room. The player must listen to the recordings and solve the math word problem that is presented. The answer to the math problem is the door code for the locked door. However, if the player enters a wrong answer the hostage will be immediately killed.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ONE MISTAKE AND THE HOSTAGE DIES</strong></h2><br/><strong>I wont kill the hostage...you will.</strong><br/><br/>The Math Problem Killer does not give you second chances. You must be accurate, or the hostage will die. In each room of each dungeon, you must solve a simple math word problem, and then enter your answer into the keypad on the locked door. If you enter an incorrect code, the hostage you are trying to rescue will be burned alive by hyrdoflouric acid. Think carefully special agent. There is zero margin for error. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2479160/extras/crate.gif?t=1708346357"><br/><br/>A single mistake will kill the hostage and cause the player to fail the level. <i>The Math Problem Killer</i> is a high consequence game in which one mistake will have dire consequences. So think carefully Special Agent.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>YOU WILL NEED A PENCIL AND PAPER</strong></h2><br/>In each room of each level, you will need to solve a math word problem, and use the answer as the code to open the locked door to the next room and ultimately the locked box that contains the hostage. The math word problems are not difficult, but you will need to gather the numbers from the disturbing stories told by the killer.  Essentially you must gather clues and piece them together in order to figure out the answer. The only way to successfully solve these math problems is utilize a pencil and piece of paper.  The player will need to write things down. Because one math mistake, and the hostage dies.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You'll also find <strong>hats</strong>. These are your actions: Equip the grapple hook hat to swing from the scenery or the dash hat for a quick horizontal burst of speed. There are dozens of unique pairings of hats and pants, and finding a winning combination - or making the most of a bad one - is what The Hamster's Journey is all about!<br/><br/>This is a game about variety of movement, and finding the right tool for the job. But then again, using the worst combinations can sometimes help you find unexpected secrets!<br/><br/>If you make it far enough - and fast enough - you can make it all the way to the end of a world, and unlock the door to the next one. In the end, perhaps the intrepid hamster really can escape and see what's out there in the real world.						</div></div>]]></description>
