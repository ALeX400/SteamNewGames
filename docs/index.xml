Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In Parkour Posse, two players take turns as the “runner” and “on-deck” moving through a level. When the 1st player reaches the end of a level, they switches places so the 2nd player can make the return trip. The runner will control the onscreen character moving, jumping, and dodging their way across the level. The player on-deck will be responsible for controlling the camera so the runner gets a better view, and providing helpful boosts when the runner needs them most.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1666800/extras/about_game.png?t=1707368381"><br/><br/>The level doesn’t reset between runs, so anything the 1st player does in the level can potentially affect the 2nd. Level completion times are cumulative, so it’s important to work together to achieve the fastest times! Work together to run, jump, and dodge your way through 20 levels in theme park of a lifetime!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1666800/extras/about_game_2.png?t=1707368381"> </img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							『ぐうたら娘更生計画～Neet Girl Rehabilitation Plan～』is a visual novel game about rehabilitating beautiful girls who have become NEETs for various reasons. Repeating dates as a form of support for social reintegration and rewards, gradually deepening the relationships from work partners to romantic interests.<br>
A Bishojo Game released in 2021 under the "Calcite" brand has been reworked for the "PandaShojo" platform for players around the world to enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
◆Introduction<br>
"I will do whatever you say if you start your job hunting."<br>
The girls found my proposal interesting and accepted the conditions.<br/>
<br/>
The reward they requested is... a date with me!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆Synopsis<br/>
The protagonist, Yutaro Miki is a rookie NEET rehabilitation officer.<br/>
A NEET rehabilitation officer is a staff member of a publicly funded, privately operated organization dedicated to the "rehabilitation of NEETs".<br/>
With the ongoing increase in NEETs becoming a serious public issue, Yutaro suddenly finds himself assigned to handle three female NEETs.<br/>
<br/>
Mei Natsume, who is lethargic and sloppy.<br/>
Kagami Yumitsuki, who has excessive paranoid delusions.<br/>
Kaede Suda, who constantly demands game competitions.<br/>
<br/>
After meeting with the three and returning to the workplace, Yutaro accidentally overhears a conversation between his superiors on break.<br/>
"If he can't rehabilitate any of the three, it would be tough for him here on out."<br/>
<br/>
If things don't go well, not only failing in rehabilitation, Yutaro himself may become an internal NEET in the company!<br/>
Will Yutaro successfully rehabilitate the lazy girls and help them find new employment?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆Characters<br/>
・Mei Natsume<br/>
"You must be going through a tough time~ It's good being unemployed, don't have to worry about any problems."<br/>
A carefree, classic-style NEET with great fashion sense and flashy hair color.<br/>
Even asking various questions about job hunting, she skillfully changes the subject with nonchalant responses.<br/>
Lacking motivation and having low self-esteem, she has no particular interest in any job.<br/>
<br/>
・Kagami Yumitsuki<br/>
"Not with anyone you dummy, it's fun being with you."<br/>
A tsundere university NEET who has quite a neat appearance.<br/>
She rejects every job offer that the protagonist recommends with many excuses.<br/>
Being a member of a literature club, she is well-versed in manga and sometimes gives recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
・Kaedeko Suda<br/>
"You are so simple. Let's enjoy more strategic maneuvering."<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2309240/extras/banner_600x359.png?t=1707322304"><br/><br/>Happy Valentine's Day! Q.P.I.D. is the latest release from Digital Eclipse Arcade, a series of all-new games inspired by classic '80s arcade vibes.<br/><br/>Like everyone else on the internet, Q.P.I.D. loves cats. Unfortunately, the cats that the Quadrangular Programmable Inversion Device has been sworn to protect have gotten themselves into places they shouldn't be. With nerves of steel and a heart of gold, Q.P.I.D. is determined to rescue as many of them as possible, even if he has to bend the laws of physics to do it. Toggle gravity, blast enemies, avoid hazards, and collect cats before your battery runs out. Part platformer, part puzzler, Q.P.I.D. delivers a hero who's state of the heart.<h2 class="bb_tag">Instructions</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Flip gravity to move objects, enemies, and obstacles<br/></li><li>Rescue cats on each level<br/></li><li>Collect all hearts for a perfect score<br/></li><li>Keep Q.P.I.D. juiced with charging stations</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Hazards &amp; Helpers</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>LOLLIDROPS aren't tasty — they're nasty. These mines will explode when you get near, but they won't be triggered by swapping gravity.<br/></li><li>HEARTACHERS demand their personal space; get too close to these shuffling scorpions, and they'll zap you. They also devour hearts!<br/></li><li>BEAM UPS shoot deadly laser light straight out when they're activated — but you can flip their switches when you flip the gravity.<br/></li><li>WUVLIES make their way the only way they know how: End over end. You can blast these flipping foes, but beware — shortly after being incapacitated, they explode!<br/></li><li>BIG CRUSHERS do exactly what their name implies: They crush (on) you big time. Don't get trapped beneath them!<br/></li><li>HEARTIANS attack in swarms when disturbed and slow you down, so be ready to blast them all before they reach you.<br/></li><li>SPEED ROLLERS give you a turbo boost. Walk through a light-blue column and get ready for a rapid ride!<br/></li><li>BOUNCE PADS put a spring in your step, sending you skyward when shifting gravity might have some negative effects.<br/></li><li>TETHERS automatically collect nearby hearts. Avoid entering dangerous spaces just by tugging on these heartstrings.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Hints</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Q.P.I.D. might fall faster or slower than some of the enemies and obstacles. Use that to sneak past them during gravity shifts.<br/></li><li>Sometimes flipping gravity will put hearts right in the path of a Heartacher. Look for alternate locomotion paths like bounce pads and speed rollers to avoid that risk.<br/></li><li>Lollidrops can't be destroyed by blasting them, but they can be deflected with a barrage of shots. Use this to create opportunities to sneak past them. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Controls</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Move: Joystick/WASD<br/></li><li>Blaster: Button 1/Mouse Button 1<br/></li><li>Flip Gravity: Button 2/Mouse Button 2<br/></li><li>Self Destruct: Button 1/Mouse Button 1 + Button 2/Mouse Button 2</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Additional Options</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>F1 toggles CRT scanlines on/off<br/></li><li>F2 toggles CRT curvature on/off<br/></li><li>F3 switches in window size in windowed mode<br/></li><li>Back button on controller accesses CRT/windowed options<br/></li><li>F9 resets the game<br/></li><li>Alt-Enter toggles between 16:9 fullscreen and 4:3 windowed mode</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">About Digital Eclipse Arcade</h2><br/>A series of throwback games made for the Digital Eclipse community, Digital Eclipse Arcade is a celebration of pure arcade gameplay.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Bust blocks on your path to victory in an adventurous mashup of nostalgic game genres!</h2><br/><br/>Classic dungeon crawling gets a block-busting twist in Dungeonoid 2 Awakening, a top-down adventure presented in retro pixel art style! In this genre mashup, you’ll pick from 4 role-playing classes, each with their own unique stats and special skill, then set off on a quest to conquer evil by controlling a floating platform to deflect a magical orb into targets along the way.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2644320/extras/Dungeonoid2Awakening_gif_02.gif?t=1707367567"><br/><br/>Move the platform left or right at the bottom of the screen and bounce the orb to keep it in play. Let the orb fly past you, and you’ll lose a heart. But fret not, by destroying walls, gravestones, enemies and more with your orb, you’ll cause power-ups and modifiers to drop towards your platform, some of which might heal you, some might shrink you, some might energize your orb for stronger attacks or have other effects! Charge your special attack to unleash particularly effective spells and attacks against big blocky bosses before they bring your adventure to an end!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2644320/extras/Dungeonoid2Awakening_gif_06.gif?t=1707367567"><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Experience a unique mix of dungeon crawling adventure and brick-breaking action!<br/></li><li>Control a deflector platform and ricochet a magic orb to destroy targets.<br/></li><li>Select from multiple role-playing character classes to suite your playstyle!<br/></li><li>Collect power-ups and modifiers to turn the tide of battle.<br/></li><li>Face off against big bosses and unleash special charge attacks!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2644320/extras/Dungeonoid2Awakening_gif_04.gif?t=1707367567"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
