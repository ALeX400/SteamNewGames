Some racers will take pity on you and give you a chance to win your money back by suggesting a 'double or nothing' race. It's your choice if you want to take that risk.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Requiring nerves of steel and a true heart of darkness, every order you give will have lasting consequences. Get into the minds of your rivals, second-guessing their every move both on the map and on the floor of Hell’s parliament as you sling insults and demands in the only truly political strategy game.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Eight playable Archfiends<br/></li><li>Eight single-player Chronicles<br/></li><li>Single-player Skirmish mode<br/></li><li>Revelations Tutorial Scenario<br/></li><li>Sessional and Asynchronous 2-6 player Multiplayer<br/></li><li>Dozens of Infernal Legions, including unique enormous Titans. <br/></li><li>Champion Praetors and dark Artifacts fit for any Archfiend!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/HeadingMulitplayer.gif?t=1708670283"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_InfernalMultiplayer_eng.png?t=1708670283"><br/>Play 2-6 player multiplayer games with your soon-to-be ex-friends in a single session of deceit and politics, or put your friendships to the test in quick daily bursts with Solium Infernum’s infamous asynchronous multiplayer for a truly harrowing scheme-in-your-sleep experience.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/Heading_DarkArt2.gif?t=1708670283"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_DivineMadness_eng.png?t=1708670283"><br/>If you love dark art, you’re in the right place. Brimming with striking visions of Hell unlike anything you’ve seen before, Solium Infernum is an infernal feast for the eyes with multitudes of individual dark paintings to enjoy. Every item of the game is accompanied by mind-blasting artwork, a feat declaring Solium Infernum a winner of the 2022 Game Makers Sketchbook.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/HeadingRessurect.gif?t=1708670283"><br/> <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_CultClassic_eng.png?t=1708670283"><br/>Originally inspired by Milton’s epic poem, Paradise Lost, League of Geeks’ (known for seminal digital board game Armello) sophomore title is a re-imagining and modernisation of Vic Davis’ critically acclaimed cult-classic of the same name, hailed as a masterpiece of strategy game design. <br/><br/>Once again, prepare to lose yourself within ‘the cold glory of a difficult decision’ as we resurrect Solium Infernum from the depths of Hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/label_praise.png?t=1708670283"><br/>Note: The following quotes refer to the original Solium Infernum (2009) by Vic Davis.<br/><br/><i>“Solium Infernum is a political wargame set in hell… The game is now finished, and none of the friends survived. By which I mean, we all hate each other now.”</i> <br/>- Rock Paper Shotgun<br/><br/><i>“It’s a game about playing other people, in both senses of the word…. This is game design based on psychology as much as rules.” </i><br/>- Quarter to Three<br/><br/><i>“More than any game I've played in years, Solium Infernum nails the sensation of staring at a screen and losing yourself in the cold glory of a difficult decision.”</i><br/>- Game Developer (formerly Gamasutra)<br/><br/><i>“Solium Infernum kicked my knees out from under me ... this game took my past experience with strategy games and threw it, like a pro basketball player, into a bin eighty feet away.”</i><br/>- Eurogamer<br/><br/><i>“One of the best games of the year.”</i><br/>— Three Moves Ahead<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1893810/extras/SI_toReign.png?t=1708670283"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You decide what you do, where to go and how best to survive. There are no NPC's barking orders at you or giving you missions you don't want to do. You give the orders, you choose what happens next.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Fight Demons</strong></h2><br/>Enter a world where nowhere is safe and fight against a range of mutated creatures, some who are almost human like, and others who are like nothing you have ever seen before.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fgoatsimulator" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/GS3_discord_banner_steam_616x140.jpg?t=1708702172"/></a><br/><br/>Pilgor's baaack! Take life by the horns in Goat Simulator 3 today!<br/><br/>Gather your herd and venture forth into Goat Simulator 3; an all-new*, totally realistic**, sandbox farmyard*** experience that puts you back in the hooves of no one's favourite female protagonist.<br/><br/>Join Pilgor and get ready to create your own whirlwind adventure on the island of San Angora. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through our open world in the biggest waste of your time since the original Goat Simulator! We won't tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/AnnouncementTrailer_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>If your dreams contain more than one goat, that works for us! In Goat Simulator 3, you can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op to create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. And don't worry, there are plenty of customisation options so you and your pals don't wear clashing outfits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Customization_Minigames_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/>Goat Simulator 3 first launched in November 2022, and since then our “game designers” have been hard at work adding even more weird and wondrous stuff. As well as all the original goat-y goodness, Steam players will be able to experience all content from the game’s post-launch updates; including the Mandatory Holiday Update, Operation Crackdown and the Shadiest Update, with more to come!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Steam_Promo_Image_Group_Shot_757.png?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/>- You can be a goat<br/>- You can be a goat… on Steam!<br/>- Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op<br/>- No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There's a goat for everyone!<br/>- Dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care<br/>- We have actual 'game designers' who have worked to create 'an okay amount of content'; including events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak<br/>- They've added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?)<br/>- They’ve even added a bunch of extra content since the game first launched, aren’t you a bunch of lucky kids?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Gameplay_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br/>Since it launched in November 2022, Goat Simulator 3 has been a completely stupid game. It is still a completely stupid game today, except now it has more stuff! By this point if you're not sure what you're getting into, we can't help you.<br/><br/><strong>NOTES:</strong><br/>* Goat Simulator 3 is technically not completely new, but it is new to Steam users!<br/>** Our game is very realistic, if you happen to be a digital goat with a proclivity for ragdolling.<br/>*** False alarm, this one is actually true.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>"Before the time of the giants, we lived freely under the Sun and Moon. Centuries have passed, but those stories of the surface world have been passed down through the generations. Now the giants are gone, and you, Vanguard, must venture out into the wilds once more, on an urgent mission. Be brave, and do not falter…"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/TreeLookingup.gif?t=1708514975"><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the vast “Land of the Small" </h2>Traverse lake sized puddles, scale skyscraper sized trees, scramble through cavernous cracks in roads, as you experience a huge open world from a new perspective.

Weather conditions and seasons are in constant flux so if you want to survive for another day, preparation is key.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Survive_the_Wilds.gif?t=1708514975"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">What is Flying Ferret?</h2>In this action game, a mysterious ferret with special jumping ability and its friends are made to jump and fly at high speed from island to island over the blue ocean to fly farther and farther.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>There was a mysterious group of animals living on a certain sea.<br/>They had incredible jumping ability and lived by flying over the island.<br/>They did not have this jumping ability when they were children, but it came as they grew older.<br/>Therefore, they all had trouble controlling it at first, but with practice they learned to jump well.<br/>There seems to be one ferret here who is practicing hard with his friends.<h2 class="bb_tag">How to play</h2>The mysterious animals that live on this island can jump amazingly high and far.<br/>Hold down the jump button to make them jump higher.<br/>When the altitude starts to drop, hit the jump button repeatedly and the ferrets will try their best to go farther.<br/>The ferret will try its best to go far away from the island.<br/>If you jump at the moment of landing, you will get a combo and jump at a higher speed.<br/>Keep jumping to reach beyond the horizon!<br/>If you fall into the sea, the game is over! One wrong decision can be fatal.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Aki’s life is nothing to write home about. She lives in Tokyo, works at an office, and she whiles away her time playing MMOs. Aki isn’t exactly happy with her lot in life, but it’s all she knows, and she’s too tired from work to change it.<br/><br/>Aki is the last person you’d expect to go on a magical adventure…<br/><br/>Until she gets hit by a truck.<br/><br/>After being mown down on her way home from work, Aki is summoned to the land of Anthem by a cat-eared witch called Mina.<br/><br/>Mina is a talented mage whose skills far outstrip most others. She promises she’ll return Aki home in due course, after she’s had a chance to replenish her magical energy, but she wants Aki to do her a favor first.<br/><br/>The priestess Luna, whom Mina was entrusted with taking care of, has been kidnapped by malevolent forces, and Mina has no idea where she is.<br/><br/>Mina enlists the help of Aki, our heroine, and Scarlet, a cheerful foxgirl, to track down Luna and punish the brigands who kidnapped her. Our trio’s journey will be far from easy, however. Attacked by thieves, assaulted by slimes, and encumbered by Aki’s own incompetence, Aki’s new life in Anthem gets off to a poor start.<br/><br/>Can an awkward, unassuming office lady like Aki really become a hero?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/AkiBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Aki is the unwilling heroine of our tale. She’s quiet and soft-spoken, and she finds it hard to assert herself. Bullied by her co-workers and criticized by her parents for her lack of ambition, Aki struggles to see herself as a warrior.<br/><br/>Contrary to her demure appearance, however, Aki is handy with a sword, being a kendo champion in her teenage years. It’s been a long time since she last wielded a blade, however, and Aki isn’t too confident about her abilities.<br/><br/>Can she really pull this off?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/minaBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Mina is a highly talented mage, and she’s the catalyst behind this tale.<br/><br/>Mina might be a prodigy, but she’s proud and haughty alongside it. She’s aware of her own strengths and she doesn’t try to downplay them. As a result, she can come across as being arrogant.<br/><br/>Mina is cold and aloof to most people, but she absolutely adores Luna. She’s determined to find Luna again, no matter how long it takes, and she doesn’t care who she drags along with her.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/scarletBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Scarlet is the third addition to Mina’s party, and she she has no shortage of energy. She’s a perpetually cheerful foxgirl who fancies herself as a brave knight, who was kicked out of her former party for being a little too enthusiastic while fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Scarlet is a fierce fighter who’s an asset to have on the battlefield…<br/><br/>When she isn’t scuppering well-laid plans by charging in like a lunatic, that is.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Letter affinities mean you'll always have a letter in your pool, and tile enchantments give a variety of powers to your monsters. Choose carefully how to upgrade--you'll need to choose rewards that counter your upcoming enemies and synergize well together.<h2 class="bb_tag">26 Starting Classes</h2><br/>Unlock a variety of starting classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.<h2 class="bb_tag">Randomized runs keep things fresh</h2><br/>Randomized enemies, terrain, upgrades, and final boss battle give each run its own flavor.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Machines are taking over your world!</strong> Their buildings destroy forests, their factories pollute the earth and water. The air is filled with the hum of drones and ships. Your home is dying!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/gom_corruption.gif?t=1708964213"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_gameplay_600x240.png?t=1708964213"><br/><br/>Gods Against Machines is an <strong>action-packed roguelite shoot'em up</strong> (with RTS ideas mixed in) where every run is different thanks to a wide variety of spells and blessings, as well as procedurally generated maps. Here is what you will do in a typical mission of the campaign:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Protect your world</strong> - Huge crystals rising from the ground are your source of mana. Protect them and (optionally, if your build includes such spells) build your base around them with spells that summon different types of buildings - mini volcanoes that bombard enemies from afar, or spirit dwellings that spawn powerful sprites to fight for you.<br/></li><li> <strong>Cast Epic Spells</strong> - Use your offensive spells to rain down destruction on your enemies - literally! Fire Rain, Thunderstorm, Meteor Storm - all powerful destructive abilities that unleash your wrath upon the machines.<br/></li><li> <strong>Control Corruption</strong> - Prevent machines from spreading corruption - either by destroying their terraformers or by cleaning the corruption yourself using various spells or minions. Do not let it get out of control or you will lose!<br/></li><li> <strong>Destroy the machines</strong> - destroy enemy buildings to deplete their resources - when they run out, you win!<br/></li><li> <strong>Boss Battles</strong> - When all of the machines' resources are used up, one of their commanders will appear - prepare for an epic final battle!<br/></li><li> <strong>Reap as many rewards as you can</strong> - the less corruption your world has suffered, the more rewards you will receive! Acquire new spells, add new abilities to existing spells, and use powerful Blessings to improve your build and find game-changing synergies!</li></ul><br/>But that is not all! Not only do you have several gods to choose from, each with their own special spells and mechanics, but there is also Gaia, the Mother of Nature. She will help you throughout the campaign and has her own special powers - and you will be able to activate some of them in each run! In addition, the game's roguelite progression is based on Gaia's powers:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Meta Progression</strong> - Each run allows you to upgrade the abilities of Gaia, who will help you throughout the campaign. The more you play, the more powerful Gaia becomes, and the easier it will be for you to progress! Go beyond the normal campaign into the Void Realm - the game's endless mode. How far can you go?<br/></li><li> <strong>Synergize your powers with Gaia</strong> - Pick the right Gaia powers to activate and get crazy synergies that are otherwise impossible. Experiment, upgrade, and replay the campaign to get the overpowered build you need to conquer even the Void Realm!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_god_600x240.png?t=1708964213"><br/><br/>Choose the god that best suits your play style! Will it be <strong>Azzinoth, God of Fire and Destruction</strong>? Or perhaps <strong>Nadea, Goddess of Water and Life</strong>? Each god has specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique mechanics - for example, if you cast powerful and expensive spells as Nadea, you will cause the sea to rise and slowly but surely drown all your enemies in its depths!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Azzinoth</strong> - the god of fire focuses on raw destructive power. With spells like <strong>Meteor Storm</strong> or <strong>Volcano</strong>, he can wipe out an entire enemy outpost with a single cast.<br/></li><li><strong>Nadea</strong> - the goddess of water does not have the powerful spells of Azzinoth, but she is more in tune with nature. Her tactics usually revolve around slowing down the corruption while building up her powers, then striking with powerful spells and her special power - the <strong>Rising Tide</strong>, which eventually drowns all who oppose her.<br/></li><li><strong>Urus</strong> - the god of earth is the lord of spirits and as such can summon them to aid him in battle. Call upon massive <strong>Earth giants</strong> or spirits of the animal kingdom and let them tear your enemies apart!<br/></li><li><strong>Zafira</strong> - the goddess of the wind is a tricky one. Her arsenal is a mystery even to the other gods. She likes to borrow their powers and break the rules - casting spells without mana or in places where others cannot. Whether it is pure destruction with the <strong>Void Beam</strong> or taking control of enemies with <strong>Confusion</strong>, she has something for every situation!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_features_600x240.png?t=1708964213"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Dynamic spellbook creation:</strong> Choose core spells, add powers to them, and upgrade their properties to create a unique spellbook. Pick powers that complement each other and quickly eliminate your enemies to limit the amount of corruption they can spread across the world.<br/></li><li> <strong>Ever-changing world:</strong> Each time you are born, you live in a new world. You will face different enemies in different environments that offer different amounts and quality of prizes. Striking the right balance between risk and reward is the best recipe for success!<br/></li><li> <strong>Blessings:</strong> Cleanse regions quickly and receive powerful blessings from Gaia, the Mother of Nature. These can dramatically change the power of your spells or even how you use them.<br/></li><li> <strong>Layered Strategy:</strong> Make strategic decisions on multiple levels - choose the right rewards, attack the weakest regions, and make sure you have a good long-term plan! Will you move slowly to reap many rewards but risk corruption taking over? Or will you move faster, but with weaker spells, giving the machines a better chance of overpowering you?</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/steam_page_header_endless_fun_600x240.png?t=1708964213"><br/><br/>Protect your home, wipe out the machines, and most of all - <strong>have a lot of fun</strong> doing it!<br/><br/>This game is influenced by modern roguelite games but allows you to control the difficulty to a large extent - choose a quick but difficult path, or move slowly and methodically, beating one enemy after another and growing your power beyond their abilities. The world you live in and the powers you gain for winning will be different each time you play, but your enemy remains the same - ruthless machines. Fortunately, their logic is predictable, and once you learn all of their tricks, you can easily wipe them out. Don't be afraid to fail! Experiment with your spell build, discover powerful combinations, and plan ahead to deal with whatever the machines have in store!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2207470/extras/gom_destruction.gif?t=1708964213"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Managing your clients is hard enough. Vera Mills won't look at herself in the mirror. Jaden Thompson's social life suffers because of his fear of heights. And Ashley Taylor is obsessed with the thought that she's psychotic like her mother.<br/><br/>But the real ordeal starts when your clients come under attack. You are gradually alienated from your colleagues as the police find only one link: you. Who is attacking your clients one by one, in gruesomely ironic ways? Eventually, it's up to you to solve the chilling mystery and unmask the serial killer.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2532020/extras/shannonSofa9.png?t=1708961638"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2532020/extras/theGameplay2.png?t=1708961638"><br/>PSYCHOLOG melds the storytelling of visual novels with the interactive elements of first-person point-and-click games. Engage in thought-provoking dialogue, make critical choices, and get to know your clients and their fears by using your empathy, finesse, and manipulation skills. Keep the trust of friends and colleagues.<br/><br/>Your choice of words during therapy sessions influences the narrative, leading to one of several distinct endings.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2532020/extras/lamp4.png?t=1708961638"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2532020/extras/theAtmosphere2.png?t=1708961638"><br/>The story unfolds in an oppressive urban setting where the sky is rarely visible, and a backrooms aesthetic permeates the bleak interiors.<br/><br/>The relentless onslaught of the game's stylized visuals amplifies the pressure and stress as those you're meant to help succumb to their worst nightmares.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Starlight and the Silver Key is a strange puzzle game about saving the world after your own world falls apart. Solve puzzles. Whisper passwords into ears. Make something called a Greasy Joe and become best buds with a demon.<h2 class="bb_tag">Narrative-Driven Experience</h2>Starlight and the Silver Key is a game about getting stuck—on puzzles AND feelings—and getting through it. Uncover a sinister plot as you confront a supernatural foe and your own grief.<h2 class="bb_tag">Blocks, Locks, and Switches</h2>Puzzles blend retro mechanics with a modern twist inspired by escape rooms. To solve these puzzles, you’ll have to figure out what the clues mean and when you can use them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Also, There are Bad Guys</h2>Match wits with Yog-Sothoth and a cast of characters that only slightly resemble Lovecraftian horrors.<h2 class="bb_tag">Tunes</h2>Original soundtrack features a sing-along experience where a lizard person named Ed teaches you how to make coffee.<h2 class="bb_tag">About the Developer</h2>Before the pandemic hit, I spent most of my time building and running escape rooms. When businesses were shuttered in 2020, Starlight and the Silver Key provided me with a creative outlet to continue building puzzles and telling stories. Outside of the music, I take responsibility for the dad jokes and the rest of the game's development.						</div></div>]]></description>

I was surprised to end up in Alcatraz. Having the best lawyer, I had hoped to be acquitted. But all his efforts to get me acquitted were in vain. My sentence screamed: "Welcome to hell, son." And so I found myself among thieves, murderers and rapists. I was quickly given a nickname - Financier (I'm a financial analyst). According to the unspoken prison laws, I had to join one of the "gangs" - the prison community. It was the only way to survive. To survive and take revenge...<br>
<br>
- A twisted plot. <br>

Relentlessly, National Socialist Germany pushed forward its campaign of destruction in all directions. Eventually, the allies made a stand to thwart the growing global threat of National Socialism's claim to world dominance. Would they have the strength to stop the Third Reich? As an American general you lead your tanks across the battlefields of Europe and Northern Africa. With the right combination of tactics and strategy you will vanquish the Wehrmacht and put an end to its campaign of destruction.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/844860/extras/features_ENG.png?t=1708952937"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Historical Setting:</strong> Experience historically correct theatres of war, from the allies' invasion of Northwest Africa and Southern Italy to the liberation of Paris and the final battle for Berlin.<br/></li><li><strong>Classic Turn-Based Gameplay:</strong> Engaging and intense – feel the heavy burden of war on your shoulders and prepare your troops for the AI's onslaught.<br/></li><li><strong>Several Theatres of War: </strong>12 historical scenarios will put your combat skills to the test.<br/></li><li><strong>Authentic Military Units:</strong> 50+ authentic combat and support units, based on real-world tanks, planes and infantry.<br/></li><li><strong>Tactical Warfare:</strong> Capture buildings, hide your unites or use other special skills. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">We were inspired by</h2><br/>Panzer Corps<br/>Panzer General<br/>Xcom<br/>Wargroove<br/>Sid Meier’s Civilization<h2 class="bb_tag">Thanks for such good and inspiring games !</h2><br/>Big support for:<br/>Steel Division 2<br/>Panzer Strategy						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

This is <strong>not a bullet hell</strong> where you need to dodge hails of bullets and patterns. Don't get complacent though, enemies will return fire. A well placed shot could ruin your timing and let that pesky missile drone through.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2543560/extras/meta.gif?t=1708948854"><br/><strong>ROGUELIKEY RUNS</strong><br/>Damage to the mothership is permanent, and if it's destroyed, you start from the beginning. Going for repairs will pass up extra cash or shiny new equipment. Procedurally generated runs deliver a constantly fresh experience, from level selection and bonuses to the enemy combinations within, they will rarely be the same.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2543560/extras/weapons.gif?t=1708948854"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2543560/extras/equipment.gif?t=1708948854"><br/><strong>ULTIMATE CONTROL, TACTICAL FREEDOM</strong><br/>Take control of an entire arsenal of weapons and gadgets.

Get style points for chaining kills.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2543560/extras/2p.gif?t=1708948854"><br/><strong>TAKE A WINGMAN</strong><br/>Two-player co-op locally with controllers and keyboard.
