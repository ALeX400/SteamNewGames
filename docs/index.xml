You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts.

Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the captivating world of Cybercore Leap, an experimental platformer game. As a passionate developer, my goal was to push the boundaries of the genre, and I'm thrilled to share this unique adventure with you.<br/><br/><strong>Innovative Jump Mechanic:</strong><br/>Experience the JumpPack, an innovative jumping mechanism that provides unprecedented control over altitude and distance. By holding the jump key, you can adjust your jump to reach new heights. However, gravity quickly takes hold when you stop using your JumpPack, requiring thoughtful strategy for each leap.<br/><br/><strong>Energy Crystals and Antigravity Grappling:</strong><br/>Master the art of mobility with energy crystals and the antigravity grapple. Cling to crystals to unleash your JumpPack from its limits, adding a new dimension to your exploration. However, every choice has consequences, as the grapple has limited reach. Find the perfect balance between the power of JumpPack and the constraints of the grapple.<br/><br/><strong>Progression and Hybrid Saving:</strong><br/>Navigate through carefully calibrated challenge-filled corridors, often requiring a unique solution. The hybrid saving system combines major save points and bonus lives provided by your faithful assistant. Enjoy the balance between challenge and second chance.<br/><br/><strong>Unique Graphics:</strong><br/>While graphics may not be my forte, the game is not uniformly ugly and has its distinct charm.<br/><br/><strong>Double Jump Mechanism:</strong><br/>Later in the game, unlock a double jump mechanism that transforms your assistant. This new ability combines with your JumpPack and Antigravity Grappling for more nuanced jump management.<br/><br/><strong>Exploration:</strong><br/>Although the game is primarily linear, maze phases add an exploration touch, with light probes to guide you and mark your path.<br/><br/>Dive into the world of Cybercore Leap where every jump, every decision matters. Let the adventure begin!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Immerse yourself in the darkness with Whispering Shadows, an immersive gaming experience that transcends traditional boundaries, exploring the deepest corners of the human mind.<br/><br/><strong>Explore Minimalist Settings, Breathe Oppressive Atmosphere</strong>:<br/>In this two-dimensional world, every step you take brings the protagonist closer to the thin line that separates reality from the nightmare. Minimalist decors, while evoking apparent simplicity, hide deep emotional nuances. Each visual element is carefully designed to amplify the emotional impact, creating a striking visual experience.<br/><br/><strong>A Unique Auditory Odyssey:<br/>Immerse yourself in this sensory experience where sound becomes your guide. The disturbing voices that resonate in your head are not just noises, but essential components of the narrative. Audio plays a crucial role, creating an immersive symphony of tormented thoughts and inner voices that guide your journey.<br/><br/><strong>Schizophrenic Narrative:<br/>Whispering Shadows offers a unique perspective by putting yourself in the shoes of a schizophrenic person. Experience the emotional ups and especially downs as you face the disturbing voices and tormented thoughts that emerge from the mind. Each breakthrough reveals a new aspect of the mental mess, offering a poignant glimpse into the complex reality of schizophrenia.<br/><br/><strong>Minimalist Gameplay, an Intimate Connection</strong>:<br/>Whispering Shadows offers minimalist gameplay to highlight the narrative and emotional aspect of the experience. Deceptively simple, your only means of interaction is a single key on your keyboard, used to advance. However, do not underestimate the power of this simplicity. Each step you take represents one more step in the protagonist’s psyche, creating an intimate connection between the player and the character.<br/><br/><strong>Evolution of the protagonist</strong>:<br/>As you progress through the various minimalist backgrounds, watch carefully the subtle changes that occur. The protagonist gradually loses color, reflecting the gradual loss of mental aspects. This visual transformation adds an emotional dimension to the gameplay, making every step significant.<br/><br/><strong>Emotional Challenges</strong>:<br/>Each scene offers unique emotional challenges, corresponding to the themes discussed, such as passion, friendship, family, love, mourning, and finally, the inevitable emptiness. These challenges manifest themselves through subtle events, visual changes, and audio variations, testing your understanding and empathy for the schizophrenic perspective.<br/><br/><strong>No Return Choice</strong>:<br/>Proceed with caution, because once you have passed a step, there is no turning back. This game mechanic reinforces the feeling of inexorability, parallel to the reality of schizophrenia, where choices can have lasting consequences.<br/><br/>Whispering Shadows offers a gameplay experience that goes beyond convention, encouraging reflection and empathy through simple but deep interactions. Each advance is an emotional exploration, an advance in the complex labyrinth of the mind. Will you dare to move forward, without ever looking back?</strong></strong> </div></div>]]></description>
