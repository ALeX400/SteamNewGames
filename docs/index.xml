<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles.

Develop your early small settlement into a city bustling with life and dripping with gold. Build, develop, manage your resources and appease the Gods. Dominate other newly rising or existing settlements of other families through conquest or peaceful talks. Diplomacy or blood… it is your choice.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_1-Build_the_mightiest_and_most_expansive_empire_of_Yucatan.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Become the architect of your mythical city</strong></h2>As the Leader, you will be responsible for every building built on your territory, such as sawmills, temples, housing, barracks and many more. Skillfully plan your city as every path may play a vital role in managing your city. Well-planned zones of your empire will have a special impact on the proper and quickly develop your city. The fate of the citizens depends on you.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_2-Become_the_architect_of_your_mythical_city.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gather resources</strong></h2>There are many resources on your territory crucial for the development, conquest and keeping your empire stable. Some will be used for daily life, other resources will have a chance to become part of a variety of weapons – so vital to plan your skirmishes.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_3-Gather_resources.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Offer sacrifices to the Gods to earn their favor…</strong></h2>Without sacrifices, there is no game based on a mythical ancient tribe, right? God's favor is one of the basic and important quests in the game. Thanks to their approval your city will not only develop freely but also expand its borders and acquire greater military and political capabilities. Satisfy your Gods to avoid their wrath. You can make sacrifices through your Priest in places of worship such as temples. Choose an appropriate slave, organize a grand festival in honor of the chosen Deity and perform secret dark rituals to the delight of the audience. In return, you can expect divine protection from different cataclysms or an increase in yields from your farms and fields.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_4-Offer_sacrifices_to_the_Gods_to_earn_their_favor….gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>… or prepare for their wrath</strong></h2>Gold, riches, extraordinary development… it can’t be that easy. Each repeating or grand one-time festival requires sacrifices. If you happen to forget about worship, the Deities will send many cataclysms to your empire or other problems that will hinder your development. Some will be more or less taxing, but it is always better to evade a lone lightning bolt striking your home and setting the city ablaze or a huge tornado wreaking havoc in your city. Plan well what and when you offer your Gods as no mortal has survived their wrath.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_5-…_or_prepare_for_their_wrath.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Conquer and enslave neighboring people</strong></h2>Every gold is paid for in blood and war is the easiest way to get rich fast. Plunder resources, earn slaves and conquer new land needed for development. Gods are not the only worry, there are other peoples and tribes aiming for the same goal as you. Organize military expeditions, and reinforce the war front or defense lines with resources, which will help in your skirmishes with the enemy. Skillful resource management during war will have an impact on whether your people will come back as victorious conquerors bearing gifts or losers. Fight for the title of the mightiest ruler of the Golden City, El Dorado!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-Last.png?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Do not lose yourself in pride.</strong></h2> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

So, for now, familiarize yourself with the wasteland - you'll spend a lot more time in it when Outcast Tales is out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Be tactical</strong> (or mash buttons;  might work just as well)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Intro.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Robots, mutants, desert raiders: almost all enemies have something up their sleeve. So do your characters: some abilities are most effective in combination with others. Find your opponents' weaknesses, humiliate them on the battlefield, and never ponder the moral implications of your actions!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Use your strengths</strong> (if you can find any)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Personas.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Combine class and personality types to give each of your characters a unique set of abilities. A Preacher Mercenary and an Antihero Mercenary will behave quite differently. Create a balanced crew, or just try out the wildest combinations to see how they turn out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Overcome challenges</strong> (or mess everything up)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Events.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Your characters will encounter dozens of unique situations that test their skill and wits. The Pacifist might talk his way out of trouble, the Egghead might try setting up traps, and the Daredevil will most likely just start blasting! In Outcast Tales, there are no wrong answers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Develop relationships</strong> (like in a dating game, but not quite)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Relations.gif?t=1706789517"><br/><br/>Your characters can develop deep bonds or even fall in love - but can also come to despise each other, all depending on your actions. Your journey can become a wholesome story about newfound friendship, or a gruesome tale of three strangers constantly at each other’s throats. Whatever sounds more fun…<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Let the chat join the action</strong> (or, more realistically, set you up)! </h2><br/>Connect the game to your Twitch account so that your viewers can influence the gameplay! The Twitch Integration feature will enable your chat to make crucial decisions during events, as well as choose your next destination or ability upgrade. And don't worry, your viewers won't ever try to harm you. They love you. Right..?						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This game includes two major parts: building a city scene using the given building blocks and finishing fire copter drills on the scene. Initially, an example city scene is included in the game. Players can build their own city scenes by editing this example. The building blocks can be assembled by matching color-coded faces on the blocks. Waypoint gates (also a type of the given building blocks) should be included in a city scene, and these gates can be connected to form a closed loop. This loop is for fire copter drills just like racetracks are for car races. A drill is finished after the fire copter flies through all waypoint gates (three laps of the loop).						</div></div>]]></description>

He awakes from a terrible dream featuring his permanently angry boss and a poorly animated unicorn... the rest is up to you.<br/><br/><br/>Follow the twists and turns of Brownie's adventure into our world (Well, Sheffield anyway) and beyond in the funniest and most ridiculous point and click to ever be solo developed by a middle aged hippy burnout.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>About this game</strong><br/>Party Pooperz is an awesome chaotic party game, where you compete against your friends. The fate of tonight’s party theme rests on your shoulders, steal guests and use items to make your party the most popular. Let the battle for the most legendary party begin!<br/><br/>Donna, Matt, John and Molly live together and have decided to throw an epic party, one that their friends will remember forever. However, there’s a slight problem - they can’t settle on the music genre for the party. They have a really big fight about what’s the coolest choice. Is Donna correct with her preference for disco, or perhaps Molly, who’s a big fan of DnB, is onto something? Or could John be right, and jazz is the way to go?<br/><br/>In this game, you and your friends get to decide the best music genre together! Settle the battle by hosting competing parties in the same room at the same time. Use a pizza item to lure party guests to your party, or throw a bottle to make your friend a little dizzy ;). Or… you can simply throw the party guests to your party and just force them into liking your party! Can you ‘throw’ the biggest party?<br/><br/><strong>Pick Up and Play </strong><br/>This game is designed for everyone to enjoy. You only need to use two buttons: a button to move and a button to throw party people, pick up, and use items! This way, even people who don't often play games can join in.  <br/><br/><strong>Choose Your Music Genre </strong><br/>Party Pooperz is a game that explores the question of the best music genre. What music genres do your friends like? Disco, hip hop, jazz, or something wilder? Choose your favorite and throw the best party!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2642330/extras/CharacterSelectionScreen.gif?t=1707162562"><br/><br/><strong>Throw a party by throwing people! </strong><br/>In this game, you can throw people to your party and let others see which party they would enjoy the most. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2642330/extras/ThrowNPC.gif?t=1707162562"><br/><br/><strong>Whack-a-Friend </strong><br/>In Party Pooperz, it's not just about partying – it's about a good-natured brawl! Got a buddy you're dying to give a playful wallop? Wield a guitar or a candy stick and spread some party cheer right across their noggin. <br/><br/><strong>Use Items </strong><br/>Sabotage other players using various items. <br/><br/>Use a matras to defend yourself from other players. Be strategic to make the most of this item! <br/><br/>What's a party without pizza? Use the pizza item to attract people to your party. <br/><br/>Make other players too dizzy to control their movements with the bottle item. Throw it at other players to use it. <br/><br/>Use the water pistol to shoot away other players from your party or to bring party people to your party. <br/><br/>Put on some good shoes and dance all night long. These shoes make you move a lot quicker!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2642330/extras/PowerUPS.gif?t=1707162562"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Socket is an indie platform puzzler in the tradition of Unravel, Limbo, and Little Nightmares. If those games are novels, consider Socket a short story that packs an emotional punch. After the death of their only human friend, two tiny androids, Socket and Birdie, must traverse the harsh landscape of Current City, sharing a single failing battery. They must recharge where and when they can, taking on increasingly difficult puzzles along the way. You play as both Socket and Birdie, switching between the two to complete tasks, and combining to conserve battery when you can. Each puzzle is a race against time, as your battery goes from green to yellow to desperate red. Condensed from an award-winning animated screenplay by bestselling author, Scott J. Holliday, Socket is a story of love, sacrifice, and what it means to have a friend. As Socket says, "Hearts break, but batteries die."<br>
<br>
Key features:<br>
<br>
- Time-based puzzle platforming.<br>
- Two character control - jumping, flying, pushing, pulling, throwing switches, stacking, and recharging.<br>
- Continue from checkpoints.<br/>
- A beautiful musical score.<br/>
- A heartfelt story of friendship and sacrifice.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

If your genre isn't well-constructed or you're not earning money quickly enough, progressing through the later stages can become extremely challenging.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/金币工厂短.gif?t=1707046756"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/晶石工厂短.gif?t=1707046756"><h2 class="bb_tag">主线任务</h2>       击杀四个Boss是您的主线任务，通过上述所有内容，强大自己，是通关的唯一方法。如果流派搭建的不够完善，或者钱赚的不够快，就很难通过后续关卡。<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/主线任务短.gif?t=1707046756"><h2 class="bb_tag">GameOver and GameWin</h2>       When you first enter the game, you'll typically face challenges and might fall in battle as early as the second Boss. If you have gaming experience, even the third Boss can pose a significant challenge. Don't worry, whether you win or lose, the game features an evaluation system that assesses your performance and grants you corresponding experience points. Each time you level up, you will randomly receive a talent or unlock a new spaceship. The number of talents you can carry into battle is limited, so you'll need to choose them wisely based on your strategy. Players will gain an additional talent slot at levels 1, 4, and 7, and then every 10 levels thereafter, up to a maximum level of 100.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/胜利升级短.gif?t=1707046756"><h2 class="bb_tag">Challenge</h2>       Once you've crafted your own genre and successfully defeated all four Bosses, you can attempt to take on even higher difficulties. The game offers 26 difficulty levels, labeled from A to Z, and it's recommended to start with the lower difficulty levels before progressing to the higher ones. Difficulties can be stacked, allowing you to challenge multiple levels simultaneously. Each selected difficulty level adds a 20% bonus to the final experience earned. If you choose all 26 difficulties, you'll face a monumental challenge that might even turn your previous gaming experiences upside down. The specifics are left for you to explore, and we wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/难度选择短.gif?t=1707046756"><h2 class="bb_tag">Module Synthesis</h2>       When specific modules reach their corresponding levels, new modules will become available for synthesis. You can check the specific synthesis formulas by clicking the 'Synthesis' button on the pause menu. Module synthesis can even lead to a profound transformation of your genre, but the details are left for you to explore on your own.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2684410/extras/合成词条短.gif?t=1707046756"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
