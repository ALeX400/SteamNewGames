<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Paintball is a top down puzzle game for 1 to 3 players.<br>
You control three characters (blue, red, yellow) who throw the paintball back and forth. While travelling the ball creates a line. This line has the color of the character who threw the ball. If the paintball travels over an already existing line, the new color and the former color mix together, creating a secondary or tertiary color.<br>
<br>
Colorexia, the evil witch possessed by shapes and colors brought 3 guys into one of her dungeons to test her new puzzles. Can you solve them all and regain your freedom?<br>
<br>
Each of the 32 levels has a given geometric and colored structure that must be copied. Tasks are sorted by dungons (triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, polyhedrons, free styles).<br>
<br/>
In addition, paintball - the puzzle game offers a free play mode, where you can create colored shapes without a task. If you like what you created, you can save the level and make it a task.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

We began working in UE5 in February 2023, and we have been relying on trial-and-error as well as Epic Marketplace assets and YouTube tutorials to create our first game ever. We are extremely passionate about this project, and we worked hard to make it our own, but we are also aware that it isn't perfect. We are telling you this in the hopes that you will limit your expectations and have a far more enjoyable experience than you would have if we pretended to be something we are not.<h2 class="bb_tag">Extra Lore:</h2> In the beginning, all of humankind started on one planet in the Inner Rim. They began exploring and building relationships with indigenous peoples on distant planets. This area of explored space became known as the Outer Rim, separated from unknown space by a border called the fringe. When their home started dying, the Galactic Council decided it would be best for humanity to split up. They started scouting planets they had previously discovered, testing to see which ones could be terraformed to become habitable. Once a planet was deemed viable, they began negotiating with native leaders to see who would take them in. This was a slow process, as some native groups were much less willing to house newcomers than others. The indigenous peoples that agreed to the treaty did so with the condition that humans would only terraform a small part of their planet so as not to disrupt the overall environment too much. Gradually, the Council was able to start sending groups of people to settle in these newly terraformed areas, known as Population Zones. At one point, humans successfully occupied over twenty different PZs, each with their own ecosystem and societal structure.<br/><br/>There was an extended period of peace as humankind learned to live amongst natives in these blended communities, utilizing portals as gateways to travel between worlds. But eventually, the humans began arguing about how to govern themselves. Humanity was divided, and a faction known as MilCorp splintered off. They declared war against the Galactic Frontier Republic and began recruiting natives to fight for their cause. The PZs erupted into violence and chaos as the regions that were once thriving became completely destabilized.<br/><br/>After a few years, the GFR was finally able to push MilCorp back into the shadows. Tensions are still high within the PZs, but the humans have begun to rebuild and continue the relocation of citizens and resources from their dying world.<br/><br/>This is where you come in.<br/><br/>Experience our universe through the eyes of Elijah Shaw, the son of a military colonel and a renowned scientist, as you journey through the Population Zones in search of the truth. Along the way, you will face numerous enemy types with varying levels of combat and encounter a slew of different puzzles to solve. Become part of our galaxy and uncover a threat far greater than MilCorp lurking just beyond the fringe.						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
