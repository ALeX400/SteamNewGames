<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming. Each R2G title is a tribute to a single hit game from the '90s: a reimagining of a single universal story for a brand-new audience, using modern means and innovative, often vastly simplified gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/pillars.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> was first envisioned as a new game mode inside the Book of Demons universe, but we soon realized that its design is huge and that it should be executed as a stand-alone spin-off game. If you want to learn more about Return 2 Games or support us in the development of the series, visit the <strong>Supporter Pack</strong> store page.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Monster Scout is a soccer game with a focus on scouting. You become a coach in the world of monster soccer, going on reconnaissance missions and scouting monsters.<br>
<br>
Players have unique characteristics, but just like in the real world, these traits aren't immediately apparent. Trust your scouting instincts and manage your team accordingly.<br>
<br>
The fate of your team depends on your discerning eye! Find strong players and scout them for your team!<br>
<br>
Players have various personalities, such as being fast runners, being good at passing, or being skilled at dribbling. However, you can't see these statuses as numerical values. You have no choice but to attend matches multiple times and find the players your team needs. Compare the player's contract money with the team's financial strength and scout strong players!<br/>
<br/>
During the match, the players move on their own. All you can do is coach, such as arranging players and swapping them with the bench. Be sure to enjoy the realistic feeling of being a coach!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>A Game About Flicking A Switch</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2672850/A_Game_About_Flicking_A_Switch/?snr=1_239_new__tab-AllNewReleases</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2672850/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is LITERALLY just a game about flicking a switch. It's in the title. You, in a room, four pale-green colored walls, stained carpet, and those funky ceiling tiles you definitely imagined punching out when you were a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking for groundbreaking mechanics? There's one function in the game - you flick a switch.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe award-winning graphics? Well, it is Unreal Engine 5. But let's be honest here, the engine is not in the slightest sense utilized to its highest ability in this game.<br/>
<br/>
How about immersive story-driven gameplay? Nope. Not here. Unless you consider the story of you really reconciling with the fact you spent money to flick a virtual switch, when you and I both know you are most likely sitting in a room right now that has a few switches scattered around the walls. Have fun staring at your bank account later, wondering where it all went wrong as you dove helplessly into the immersive world of a 9x9x9 room with ONE SWITCH ON THE WALL FOR YOU TO INTERACT WITH.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, let's jump ahead to the key features:<br/>
<br/>
There are none.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how you judge the "ending" of a game, or how you would quantify your sense of sanity in terms of time spent playing a game where you do absolutely nothing but stand in a single room flicking a single switch as time around you ticks on; endlessly disregarding any sense of desperation for it to slow down so that you may bask in the sanctity of joy for even a brief moment, until hopefully the power cuts out, or someone comes to your aide to end this troubling sense of self infliction -- It should take you around 1 - 30 minutes to complete the game.<br/>
<br/>
Buy it, don't buy it. Totally your decision. This game will not keep you up at night, nor will it have you beckoning for more; but if for some reason it does butter your cups, douse your daisies in oil, or roll your drums, then I may consider you take some time away from gaming for a short period, or maybe the whole period.<br/>
<br/>
I do not, in any sense of lacking the word, hope that you do not find, to any extent, any sense of enjoyment from this game.<br/>
<br/>
Final note: The selected reviews above are totally not from ChatGPT. They are real, and so are the names of those who wrote them.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FmeSfrrUQ2x" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/StoneFront_Top_New.jpg?t=1707792718"/></a><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/Battle.gif?t=1707792718"><br/><br/>Rune Gate: Retribution unveils a sneak peek of the 'Retribution' game mode, soon to premiere in Rune Gate. This mode delivers a condensed but intensively challenging experience, inviting players to overcome increasingly difficult trials and ascend the leaderboard. Fundamentally, the game is a deck-building roguelite that allows for deep customization of cards through the integration of various elemental runes, offering a unique blend of strategy and personalization.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/StoreTitles_CustomizeCards.jpg?t=1707792718"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/Customization.gif?t=1707792718"><br/><br/>The Rune system makes card customization swift and effortless. You have the freedom to forge synergies between cards, determining their power and utility. Insert attack runes for high-damage cards; use draw or energy runes for utility cards; and debuff runes transform your cards into potent curses. Want more versatility? Simply upgrade your card to add a new rune slot!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/StoreTitles_ElementalRunes.jpg?t=1707792718"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/RuneTypes.gif?t=1707792718"><br/><br/>Currently, the game features nearly 200 unique runes, each with its own signature abilities and constraints. Players can acquire runes by winning combats, crafting them from lower-tier runes, or obtaining them through encounters and merchant inventory.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/StoreTitles_FormSquad.jpg?t=1707792718"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2731350/extras/StoneTitles_SquadImage.jpg?t=1707792718"><br/><br/>In the game, you lead a party of champions against adversaries. Each champion wields a specific type of weapon and utilizes unique runes. Every weapon type corresponds to a distinct deck, offering a unique set of cards for strategic deck-building. With 18 champions available, featuring three from each elemental type, a rich variety of team compositions and strategies awaits your command.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gears and Augments</h2><br/>Not only do you acquire runes following combat, but you can also obtain gear and augments. Gear enhances your champions' offensive and defensive capabilities and includes runes for further customization. Augments provide unique buffs to your champions during combat, offering additional strategic depth.<h2 class="bb_tag">Units to Summon</h2><br/>Followers represent another form of 'Gear' available in the game, capable of being summoned as allies during battles. They each possess a distinct set of cards that can be customized with runes, and can be a great help to your mid to late game strategy.<h2 class="bb_tag">Meta Progression</h2><br/>Fame is earned through combat across different realms, and it serves as a key resource. You can utilize this fame to permanently unlock specific runes, granting yourself a range of advantages that significantly aid in progressing through future runs.<br/><br/>-Discord: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FmeSfrrUQ2x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/meSfrrUQ2x</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
