Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using Proton you may need to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7D01-D2DD-D75E-2955" rel="" target="_blank">set the launch options</a> to:<br/>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%<h2 class="bb_tag">General Control of the Game</h2>SHIFT+L: <strong>Load Game</strong><br/>SHIFT+S: <strong>Save Game</strong><br/>Ctrl+C / Pause Key:       <strong>Pause Game/Exit Level</strong><br/>Left Click:                      <strong>Select Unit or Building</strong><br/>SHIFT+Left Click:           <strong>Select Multiple Units</strong><br/>Double Left Click:          <strong>Select all similar units in view</strong><br/>Right Click on Map:       <strong>Tell unit(s) to go there.</strong><br/>Right Click on Enemy:   <strong>Tell unit(s) to attack unit or building</strong><br/>Escape:                          <strong>Abort whatever unit/building is doing</strong><br/>A:                                   <strong>Attack unit, building, or terrain</strong><br/>Left Click Mini-map:      <strong>Change view area to that part of map</strong><br/>Right Click Mini-Map:    <strong>Send selected unit(s) to that area</strong><br/>Mouse at Screen Edge:  <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><br/>Cursor Keys:                   <strong>Scroll Viewing Area</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">First Priorities</h2>You have between 9 and 10 minutes before the enemy will <br/>    attack.  Use that time to start harvesting resources and<br/>    building up defenses.<br/><br/>Minerals - You will need to build a smelter (Hotkey T) near <br/>    where you see rocks and crystals.  Use the builder to pick <br/>    up minerals and drop them along sides of the smelter <br/>    building.  The smelter will automatically pick them up and <br/>    process them as it needs. <br/><br/>    Start with the crystals first, as they are the highest <br/>    value resources.  When those run out, you can process the <br/>    rocks, starting from the largest to the smallest.<br/><br/>Solar Power - You will first need to build a power station <br/>    (hotkey A) somewhere on the map.  Once it is finished, you <br/>    can build up to 8 solar panels around the power station.  <br/>    If you need more than 8 panels (which you probably will) <br/>    then build an additional power station.<br/><br/>Gas Refinery - Build the refinery (hotkey G) on top of <br/>    volcanos.  The more volcanoes you tap, the more gas you'll <br/>    have available.<h2 class="bb_tag">Setup Defenses</h2>    You can move rocks or build walls to fortify the areas <br/>    most vulnerable to attack.  Then build sentry tanks at the<br/>    factory and move then a few spaces behind your wall, as <br/>    they have a very long firing range.  Be sure to set them <br/>    to sentry mode (hotkey S).  If they aren't spinning, then <br/>    they aren't going to defend!<h2 class="bb_tag">Build A Radar Station</h2>    This game does not employ a fog of war, and you can always<br/>    see anything in the main view area.  However, if you want to<br/>    be able to see both player and enemy mobile units live on <br/>    the mini-map, a radar station must be present. Player units<br/>    show up in white, while Protoid units are yellow.<h2 class="bb_tag">Balance Of Units</h2>    Obviously not all units are equal.  Some are slow, some are<br/>    fast.  Some are cheap, and some are expensive.  A small<br/>    group of heavy tanks, for example, could decimate your <br/>    opponent's base. However, they are expensive, take a long<br/>    time to build, and they are slow to move.  On the flip side<br/>    of that, ATVs are cheap and fast, but not very powerful.<br/><br/>    In time, you will learn which units are best suited for<br/>    different strategies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Missile Silo</h2>    Missiles can devestate your opponents base easily.  But be<br/>    warned, they are expensive and slow to build.  You must<br/>    also build a new missile for each launch.<br/><br/>    The coordinate system used is based on how many spaces <br/>    relative to the silo the target is.  So, if you have more <br/>    than one missile silo, the coordinates will not be the same<br/>    for each one.  Also the coordinates are shown in hexa-<br/>    decimal.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Protoids</h2>    It is good to know your enemy.  The Protoids will typically<br/>    not attack your base until their army has reached a certain<br/>    size.  However, they will always rush to defend the base if<br/>    you attack them.<br/><br/>    They aren't too bright when it comes to navigating the map<br/>    to attack your base.  However, their tanks will blast<br/>    through terrain objects that are in the way, or even build<br/>    bridges over water, thus allowing the rest of the units<br/>    a path to your base.  <br/><br/>    Protoids do rebuild their base if pieces of it are<br/>    destroyed.  So don't wait too long after a partially<br/>    sucessful attack, or you may have to start all over again.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty Levels</h2>    There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.<br/>    There are numerous things that change with each level. Some<br/>    things are small, such as the ratio of tanks vs soldiers<br/>    that are built.  Also the number of sentry pods that the <br/>    Protoids build varies.  It is as little as 4 pods per base<br/>    in easy mode, to 12 pods in hard mode.  <br/><br/>    In easy mode, the protoids will not even build a factory, <br/>    hence no tanks will be made. And with no tanks, the Protoids<br/>    will not cross water or create paths through forest or<br/>    rocks.  <br/><br/>    In hard mode, the Protoids will build two bases at the<br/>    start of the game.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to Site 72, the 72nd largest human containment facility in the world. Here, many people work together – you'll make friends in no time.<br/><br/>In this game, you're tasked with finding humans whose hearts have been invaded by a parasite called "Rubyuk." You'll be operating in the human residential area, searching for Rubyuk.<br/><br/>Your job is simply to locate who is hosting Rubyuk... of course, with the aid of a specialized sensor. No expertise needed. Just set it up and power it on.<br/><br/>Be warned, though, the sensor's signals are unique and might cause nausea or hallucinations in some. But don't worry, it's all safe. After all, every job has its hardships, right?<br/><br/>"Days like a nightmare"? Can you read that graffiti on the wall? Ah, Arabic, I see. I didn't even recognize it as writing. My mistake. Oh well, it's just graffiti, probably written out of boredom.<br/><br/>Get ready for a little mental challenge. Once you've placed the sensors and powered them, check their readings to deduce which person hosts Rubyuk. Be aware, there are unnecessary Rubyuk mutations that might also show up on the sensors.<br/><br/>"Queen"? Just a rumor, nothing to worry about. It's like a queen ant, nothing more. Besides, a Rubyuk queen wouldn't be in a place like this.<br/><br/>Now, to start. Please pull the three sensors into the investigation area...<br/><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>This game is a logic-based challenge set in a small room where you must guess which person is infected with the parasite Rubyuk.<br/></li><li>The atmosphere is eerie, with a few jump scares.<br/></li><li>The game progresses from DAY1 to DAY7, with levels up to DAY4 serving as tutorials, and DAY7 featuring a special custom mode.<br/></li><li>The rules are simple, but the introduction of different Rubyuk variants complicates the deductions.<br/></li><li>While you can think at your own pace, there are some action elements when enduring the "Nightmare" attacks.</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>"I'm writing to myself so they won't find my words..."</i><br/><br/><i><strong>Notes To Myself</strong> is a first-person horror game where you must navigate and escape from the embodiments of your worst fears. Pull switches, collect flashlights and run from demons in an unsettling world that exists between reality, your nightmares and your OS.</i><br/><br/><strong>So, you want to escape from the control of your keepers?</strong> Maybe the inspections have been getting a little "too much" for you, or you wonder if you'll ever stop scratching the day counts into the wall/wrist? It ain't so simple, I'm afraid, since you are unable to function in the "real world" and you've been sedated for so long it is impossible to tell what is real and what is fantasy.<br/><br/><strong>Well, let's break it down:</strong> when you are scratched, the scratch doesn't hurt, but you interpret it as pain, yes? So is this world, reality on the outside but the horrors of the world on the inside... or is it? Maybe all of those sedatives actually made you pass into the "other world" where there really isn't any escape?<br/><br/><strong>Fortunately for you, the player can always reset the game</strong>, and maybe you'll be safe... or be trapped forever until the next update?						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong><u>Don't Leave Story</u></strong><br/><br/>Once upon a time, in a small town nestled between mist-covered mountains, there lived a wise and just judge named Justice Harlan. He was renowned for his fair decisions and unwavering commitment to justice. However, his life took a bizarre turn when he found himself at the center of an otherworldly mystery that would shake the foundations of his beliefs.<br/><br/>One gloomy evening, after a particularly long day in the courtroom, Judge Harlan retired to his quaint cottage on the outskirts of town. Unbeknownst to him, a group of paranormal beings had been observing him from the shadows. These beings, ethereal and mysterious, were fascinated by the concept of human justice and intrigued by the power wielded by the judge.<br/><br/>As the clock struck midnight, the paranormal beings decided to make their presence known. The room filled with an eerie glow as they materialized before Judge Harlan. They were beings of light and shadow, with eyes that sparkled like stars. The judge, initially startled, quickly composed himself and demanded an explanation for their intrusion.<br/><br/>The leader of the paranormal beings, a being with a voice like a gentle breeze, spoke to Judge Harlan. "We have been watching your pursuit of justice, and we are both curious and impressed. We have decided to challenge your understanding of justice and morality."<br/><br/>Judge Harlan, ever the rationalist, was skeptical but intrigued. The paranormal beings presented him with a series of perplexing cases that transcended the boundaries of human understanding. These cases involved supernatural elements, moral quandaries, and cosmic dilemmas that pushed the judge's intellect to its limits.<br/><br/>As the days turned into weeks, Judge Harlan found himself engrossed in these otherworldly trials. The paranormal beings, pleased with his thoughtful deliberations, continued to present increasingly complex scenarios. The judge's reputation in the human realm suffered as he spent more time with the paranormal beings, neglecting his duties and responsibilities.<br/><br/>Word of the judge's strange behavior spread throughout the town, and the once-admired figure became an object of suspicion and fear. The townspeople, unable to comprehend the supernatural nature of his trials, believed he had made a pact with dark forces.<br/><br/>One fateful day, the paranormal beings, satisfied with the judge's growth and wisdom, vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared. Left alone and abandoned, Judge Harlan returned to his duties in the human realm, but the damage was done. The townspeople, unable to understand the cosmic trials he had faced, continued to view him with distrust and disdain.<br/><br/>And so, Justice Harlan lived out his days haunted by the memories of the paranormal trials, forever marked by an otherworldly encounter that had cost him the respect of his community. The story of the judge's abandonment by paranormal beings became a cautionary tale in the town, a reminder that the pursuit of justice could sometimes lead one down a path that transcends the boundaries of the known and the unknown.<br/><br/><strong><u>Features:</u></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2737320/extras/1.gif?t=1703878559"><br/>- You can eliminate your fear, at least a little, with interactive household items.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2737320/extras/2.gif?t=1703878559"><br/>- It's completely up to you to get out of this place.
