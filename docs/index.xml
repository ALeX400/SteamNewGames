Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home.

Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run!

Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Planet S is a real-time strategy game where your goal is to colonize multiple planets in a solar system to advance your civilization, build a city and supply it to grow your faction.<h2 class="bb_tag">Procedural planets</h2>The world consists of up to 14 procedurally generated planets which you can colonize. A planets type affects things like the appearance, the farm productivity and the kind of resources you can find on it. Every player starts the game with a spaceship and enough materials to colonize their first planet. Uncolonized planets can be claimed by building a spaceport on it. Once you claimed a planet, you can integrate it into your economy! <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/PP.gif?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Build your civilization</h2>To advance your faction and unlock new buildings you need to attract residents and provide them the goods they require. By gaining more and more residents, you will unlock new production chains which will increase in complexity. At some point, your first planet won't be able to supply you with the resources you need, so you need to expand to other planets. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/Build_Your_Civ.gif?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Choose your path</h2>While you start your population with workers, you need to make a decision when you advance to the second tier. You can upgrade your residents to the science or military civilization type. You can adjust the direction in an adjacent city center. Your decision will determine your path for the game and set a focus on either a more peacefully or a violent way of playing and winning the game. It may be rational to carefully consider your decision and adapt to the situation you are in. <br/><br/>Residents of a civilization type generate either science or military research points, which you can invest into research. The two research trees unlock bonuses and unique buildings for the corresponding civilization type. Through that, the game experience will rely heavily on the path you select. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/Choose_your_path.png?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer</h2><br/>You can play alone or with up to three friends. You can either practice diplomacy and negotiate agreements, or act militarily against each other. Coupled with the fact that each player can build his civilization differently, every game remains exciting. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/War.png?t=1700519036"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>A <i>free</i> game by the co-creator of the XBox's Fable series.</strong><br/><br/>Five hundred years ago, the land of Caldera was plunged into endless darkness. Decades later, five moons rose in the sky, bringing light to the world and strange Gods with it. With them came the Dreams: calls to Devotion promising supernatural Gifts.<br/><br/>Thus, the new Calderan civilisation was born; a world of Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts, with a Dreamless Archon acting as the Gods' mortal representative. But Archons are not eternal, and a successor must be found.<br/><br/>You are Dreamless: free to choose your own destiny, to ask questions others dare not, or even become Archon yourself.<br/><br/>What will you do, Dreamless one?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>Moonring is a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games, but created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities.<br/><br/>The world's geography is hand-designed, but the deadly dungeons beneath the surface reconfigure each time you leave... or die.<br/><br/>Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera. Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>Features:<br/>- Large, hand-designed open world<br/>- An infinite supply of dungeons generated using your character name<br/>- Over 100 varied enemy types, from fodder to bosses<br/>- 35 unique Gifts from the Gods, their usage changing with the moon phases<br/>- Sailing, ship-to-ship combat and boarding<br/>- A Dungeon Synth OST with over 50 tracks, all made using retro Mod Trackers!<br/>- A hidden magic system and many other mysteries<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>A note from the creator:<br/><br/>Hi folks. I've loved RPGs since the early 1980s, and grew up playing games like Lord British's 'Ultima' series and early Roguelikes. This is my love-letter to a style of gaming that has largely fallen out of fashion: with its vivid, bright sprites overlaid on stark black backgrounds, true open-world gameplay, and lack of handholding. The days I spent playing these games were spent in joyful exploration and discovery, venturing into the dark unknown, a co-author of the experience, filling in the gaps left by the primitive art with my imagination. For those of you who did the same, I hope Moonring recaptures some of the spirit of those days for you. For those who did not, I hope that the more modern conveniences you find in this game allow you to catch a glimpse of what we did 40 years ago.<br/><br/>My heartfelt thanks to all who spared even a moment to play this. Please be kind to my mistakes. I will fix them. :-)<br/><br/>- Dene						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a game of drawing lines and receiving water. <br>
The small water cup in the game feels particularly sad because there is no water in the cup. Let's help it successfully receive water together. In the game, we need to draw lines to guide water into the water cup to pass the level. Drawing lines requires ink, and the less used, the higher the star rating. <br>
Note that you can use fixed objects around you to maintain the position of the line segment.<br>
 The entire game has almost only two shades of blue and white, and the characters and scenes are also outlined with extremely simple lines.<br>
 Simplicity exudes a sense of mystery and looks unique. With beautiful graphics, elegant music design, and simple yet compact operation, the game can bring players a very relaxed gaming experience. Now let's challenge together!						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Run</strong>, <strong>jump</strong>, <strong>puzzle</strong>. The tasks you have to master in Obby with Kitty.<br/><br/>Obby is a combination of obstacle and jumping puzzle. The goal is to find the right path and, above all, to master it. Kitty has to make it through different levels. Sometimes you are above the clouds, sometimes in a dark dungeon or trying to cross a lake.<br/>Jumping from stone to stone may sound easy, but if these stones move or are barely bigger than you, the whole thing becomes much more difficult.<br/>If one or two puzzles are added or precise timing is required, the level of difficulty increases enormously.<br/>At the beginning it might be enough for you to reach the end of a level with a lot of targeted jumps and some timing, if necessary with a little help.<br/>But if you want to collect all the stars or even be among the first in the leaderboard, every jump has to be perfect and your timing must always be right.<br/>It sounds difficult, and it is. But who doesn't love a challenge?<br/><br/>- Master tricky jumps<br/>- Balance over narrow bridges<br/>- Avoid nasty traps<br/>- Solve puzzles<br/>- Find the right timing<br/><br/>- 21 story levels<br/>- 15 story levels in particularly difficult mode including a leaderboard<br/>- 2 extra levels with 2 special modes<br/>- Play as Kitty or one of her friends (friends only available outside of the story)						</div></div>]]></description>
