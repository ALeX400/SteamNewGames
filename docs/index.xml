      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">A lively parade with hololive VTubers and mascot characters!</h2><br/>"HoloParade" is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for "holo Indie". Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It's a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.<br/><br/>What is "holo Indie"?:<br/>It is a general term for a game brand for derivative work games, produced using the "game creator support program" with the aim of co-creating with fans and creators of hololive Production around the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 1: Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</h2>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy's base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's an element inspired by parades called the 'Symphony Effect,' where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Battle.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 2: Comprehensive Development Elements</h2>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a 'Skill' system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Skill_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 3: No Gacha Purchases, No Stamina System</h2>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.<br/><br/>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Gacha_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 4: Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</h2>When you return to the office, the home screen, you'll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Home_ENG.png?t=1701417555"><br/><br/>Additionally, mini-games with entirely different gameplay from the main story are implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. At the initial release, a mini-game titled "Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!" is available, where Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with hololive) who overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles. More mini-games are planned to be added in future updates.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/RunMikoti.gif?t=1701417555"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You are Harry Herman, an employee of Delta Laboratories who researches interdimensional traveling. You had been participating in a project that was supposed to benefit all humanity, but something went wrong. Through the gameplay, you will solve various physics-based puzzles using an energy-manipulating weapon, travel across space and time to explore surrealistic universes and find out the dark truth about this project and your connection to it.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_gameplay.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Solve various puzzles and trick enemies using physics interactions and your special tool - the Portable Energy Manipulator. <br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS PUZZLES &amp; INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gameplay_physics.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>Many objects in the game can be picked up, brought somewhere, or manipulated in other ways. Whether it's a computer terminal, a box you can carry, or a simple mug on a table. Explore various interactive environments to find clues and return to the riddle with a solution, which in some cases may be several. Nothing was made for you to solve, there's no cube dispenser or an obvious exit door at the end. It's all for you to figure out.<br/><br/><strong>PORTABLE ENERGY MANIPULATOR</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gif_photongun.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>The device you carry throughout the game can absorb different energy types from the environment and use them to perform various tasks.<br/><br/>Absorbing energy from a particular source will give the gun its‚Äô properties. The heat energy from fire and radiators will melt glass, security cameras can be blinded by a beam of light, and for powering generators, you can take hazardous radiation from toxic puddles scattered across Delta Labs facilities. And of course, you will make an encounter with the quantum entanglement energy - the mysterious power capable of opening rifts between worlds. <br/><br/>Apart from solving environmental puzzles, your device can also be used against various creatures you'll meet in parallel dimensions. Most of the time you can't defeat your enemies; instead, you can use the Manipulator to outsmart or suspend them. Some enemies can be frozen in place using the force field energy, while others are sensitive to light and can be distracted by shooting a beam at it in the distance. You will require more advanced strategies and combining various energy types to pass them.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_story.png?t=1701271403"><br/>You find yourself in one of Delta Labs' off-world research facilities in an unknown dimension that looks more like a crashing-down laboratory. Your old friends Eugene and Alex try to connect with you shortly, and with their help, you start a journey through various dimensions. You will learn different physics interactions and meet unusual creatures on your way home. Along this, you have to unveil the mysteries of this project and your past. <br/><br/>Experience a non-linear story where your choice always matters. Can you get to the bottom of this, or just try to escape? Who to listen? Who to trust? Which side will you take? And will you finally ‚Äúbreak the Principle‚Äù? That depends entirely on you.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_setting.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Make your way back to Earth through mysterious parallel dimensions littered with puzzles and secrets, uncover mysterious connections between the worlds you visit, and reveal the dark truth about Delta Labs and your involvement with them.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>‚ÄúAll is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come‚Äù, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape‚Äôs audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. ‚ÄúTime ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles‚Ä¶ but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh‚Äîdon‚Äôt come too close, you don‚Äôt want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?‚Äù The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. ‚ÄúAh, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots ‚Äì what could all this mean?‚Äù<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1701355158"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures‚Äô needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side.

Greetings, fellow adventurers and visionaries of the gaming realm! We stand at the threshold of a new era in gaming ‚Äì an era where your creative impulses take center stage. Welcome to the latest evolution of Creative Continents, where the journey towards true gaming freedom begins.<br>
<br>
When I embarked on the Creative Continents journey, I envisioned more than just a game. I saw a platform that would give players the ability to sculpt their own realms, craft personalized maps, and forge unforgettable experiences with friends. Today, I am thrilled to present a world where this vision has started to become reality, offering you an opportunity like no other.<br>
<br>
Picture this: you have the power to shape the very land beneath your feet, to cultivate a landscape that resonates with your imagination. With a diverse palette of 50 land types and an array of vibrant foliage at your fingertips, your creative expressions know no bounds. But the journey doesn't halt at creation; it's an invitation to immerse yourself in a vivid third-person perspective and explore the fruits of your labor.<br>

This experience is far from solitary. Through seamless integration with Steam Multiplayer, your friends can join you on your journey, coexisting in the world you've sculpted. In Creative Continents, the traditional barriers between developer and player dissolve. The narrative is yours to weave, and the destiny of your world lies in your capable hands.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the development of this experience, my goal has been profound: Can we, as creators, relinquish control and hand the reins of power over to you, the players? Can we pave the way for an experience where you are not just gamers, but architects of your own digital destinies?<br/>
<br/>
Together, we venture into uncharted territory, a realm where creative freedom isn't a promise but a reality. Creative Continents is more than a game; it's a testament to your ingenuity, your aspirations, and your ability to reshape the landscape of gaming itself.<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Raincouver: Infected Descent<br>

Welcome to Raincouver, a sprawling cyberpunk metropolis on the brink of oblivion.

<br>
In the midst of the chaos, a beacon of hope emerges‚Äîa scientist who holds the key to a cure. Your mission expands beyond the rescue as you strive to find and extract this crucial figure. Every decision counts, as you balance the urgency of saving Raincouver with the pursuit of the elusive cure.<br>
<br/>
Raincouver: Infected Descent is a challenging single-player experience that demands skill, strategy, and resourcefulness.

Can you rescue your girlfriend, secure the cure, and defy the impending apocalypse?

-    Many enemy Ancients on the battlefield with different strengths that you must be careful to defeat.<br/>
-    Maps full of challenges, every enemy is very dangerous!<br/>
-    Simple and intuitive controls, move in four basic directions, and gun towers will move in the direction of your movement. If Ancients are nearby, your gun tower will automatically target them.<br/>
-    Shoot and switch weapons flexibly to destroy enemy Ancients, and make use of the items you've collected to repair your vehicle right on the battlefield.<br/>
