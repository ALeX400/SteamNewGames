<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Peril racks Spirit Island. The invaders are more numerous and more capable than ever before. As hope begins to fade, defense of the island falls to those spirits more in tune with the danger and chaos of the natural world. Will you be able to harness their power to protect the island or will it fall to the persistence of the invaders? Whatever the outcome, Spirit Island will never be the same after the time of <strong>Jagged Earth!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Jagged Earth is currently at a 20% discount from its final regular price (expected to be $24.99 USD). As more content is added, the price will increase until the DLC is complete at its full price.</h2><br/><strong>Jagged Earth includes:</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Spirit - Stone's Unyielding Defiance:</strong> Some things refuse to break. Underneath the soil and sand of the island lies rock, layer upon layer built up over the ages. Some stones weather quickly once exposed to the elements, while others are sterner and harder. This is a Spirit of that stone which resists being shattered, moved, or shaped to the will of another. It’s not unfriendly to other Spirits or the Dahan, but it works with them on its own terms.<br/></li><li><strong>Spirit - Vengeance as a Burning Plague:</strong> A Spirit of vengeance, anger, and retribution. It slumbers in a simmering volcanic pool, awakening at unpredictable intervals… or when roused through supplication by one wronged. Most Dahan consider this foolhardy, for it vents its wrath on entire communities, and its pestilence may spread anywhere. It is unclear whether its recent waking is due directly to the ravaging of the Invaders or to some Spirit’s pleas.<br/></li><li><strong>Adversary - The Habsburg Monarchy (Livestock Colony):</strong> Emperor Joseph I inherited The Habsburg Monarchy upon the death of his father, Leopold I, shortly after the conclusion of the War of the Spanish Succession. Habsburg colonies are newer than those of any European power save Russia but have grown quickly due to their focus on nomadic herding rather than farming and infrastructure.<br/></li><li>57 new <strong>Major and Minor Power Cards</strong> with new game mechanics: <strong>Badlands</strong> tokens, <strong>Isolate</strong>, and pieces counting as other pieces.<br/></li><li>30 new <strong>Event Cards</strong> that more than double the size of the Event deck.<br/></li><li>2 new double-sided <strong>Island Boards</strong> (E &amp; F and their thematic sides).<br/></li><li>6 new Fear Cards and 7 new Blight cards for added game-to-game variety.<br/></li><li><strong>Much more content and features coming in phases to follow!</strong> See below for details.</li></ul><br/>Branch &amp; Claw is not required in order to purchase &amp; play Jagged Earth. <br/><br/>Further content will be released in 8 phases (contents &amp; order subject to change based on development). No additional purchases will be required; when the game is updated with each phase, you will gain access to the new content with your existing purchase of Jagged Earth.<h2 class="bb_tag">"The Teeming Host Arrives"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Many Minds Move as One </li><li> Adversary: The Tsardom of Russia</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Visions of a Shifting Future"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Fractured Days Split the Sky<br/></li><li> 6 Aspects</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Home of the Island's Heart"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Lure of the Deep Wilderness<br/></li><li> Scenario: The Great River</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Explosive Eruption"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Volcano Looming High<br/></li><li> Scenario: Elemental Invocation</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Lost in the Swirling Haze"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Shroud of Silent Mist<br/></li><li> Scenario: Despicable Theft</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Observe the Ever-Changing World"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Shifting Memory of Ages<br/></li><li> Play Option: Archipelagos (multiple smaller islands)<br/></li><li> Play Option: Including an Extra Island Board (larger islands)</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Let's See What Happens"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Grinning Trickster Stirs Up Trouble<br/></li><li> Play Option: Combining Two Adversaries</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">"Growth Begets Growth"</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Spirit: Starlight Seeks Its Form<br/></li><li> Play Option: 5-6 player support</li></ul><br/><i>The Invaders strip the land bare, voraciously consuming all they find in service of their cities, their herds, their distant empire. As life’s web is torn asunder, even the more destructive among us must succumb. But three things may yet allow us to survive.<br/><br/>The first is our will: our resolution, our defiance, our unyielding intent. We have the weight of ages behind us, and each others’ voices to give us hope and inspiration. What we dream firmly enough may become real.<br/><br/>The second is the land: we make it deadly, transform it to an unlivable misery. We cloak it with fear, hide it from mortal eyes, entrap it in time like a bug in amber. We call forth its beasts and swarms, its poisons and perils.<br/><br/>The third is the Dahan: even now, they fight a thousand small struggles against the Invaders. They speak of our anger, rally to the defense of their kin, and hold out in ways we can barely perceive. Some may still trade with the Invaders, but we no longer fear a Third Reckoning: the Spirit-speakers assure us of that, at least, and in return we will aid and protect the Dahan as we can.<br/><br/><strong>Let us not falter.</strong></i> </div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE01_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG1.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG2.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE02_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG3.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE03_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG4.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE04_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE05_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG5.gif?t=1709230146"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera.

The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Photo_Album.png?t=1709211400"><h2 class="bb_tag">Track Your Progress in the Photo Album</h2>Your photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif1.gif?t=1709216510"><br/><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance</strong> is a <strong>real-time strategy game</strong> based on the Terminator: Dark Fate universe that follows the war between humanity and Legion's synthetic intelligent machine network.<br/><br/>In the<strong> single-player campaign</strong>, you take the role of a commander in the Founders, a force made up of the remnants of the US military and guide your army in an attempt to foil Legion's plan to exterminate the last remnants of humanity. In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion.<br/><br/>Take control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps. Make decisions about unit placement, battle tactics and abilities so that you don’t just survive but can become the leader of the resistance against the machines. Hone your skills and military expertise by replaying and achieving the best possible outcomes.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Dynamic battlefields: realistic tactics and consequences</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif2.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>Engage in complex, realistic battles where your <strong>tactical decisions</strong> are vital to your survival and ultimate victory. Use a variety of military equipment, vehicles and ammunition types in your battles against the enemy. Recruit and train new units, assign new skills and acquire new weapons and equipment to continue the resistance.<br/><br/>Encounter tense battles. Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Lead the survival of mankind</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif3.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>Recruit others to your cause and <strong>grow your army</strong>. Mix and match the composition of your troops to fit your preferred battle tactics. Use infantry units, heavy armoured military vehicles, plasma cannon technology, drones and other flying units and even human skirmishers to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Use the battlefield to your advantage! <strong>Physics-based building demolition</strong> lets you generate a realistic set of tactical consequences, especially in urban areas.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer Mayhem: Skirmish and Online Battles</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif4.gif?t=1709216510"><br/>The excitement amplifies in <strong>skirmish and multiplayer modes</strong>, where <strong>you can play as three distinct factions</strong>: Founders, Movement, and Legion. <br/><br/>Engage in epic battles across vast strategic landscapes, testing your skills and military expertise. Every decision matters, impacting alliances, missions, and the overall survival of mankind.<br/><br/>Challenge your skills in skirmish and online multiplayer matches, facing off against AI or real-life human opponents in intense 1v1 and 2v2 battles.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Put on a jetpack for all we care<br/>- We have actual 'game designers' who have worked to create 'an okay amount of content'; including events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak<br/>- They've added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?)<br/>- They’ve even added a bunch of extra content since the game first launched, aren’t you a bunch of lucky kids?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/850190/extras/Gameplay_GIF_5sec_616x296.gif?t=1708702172"><br/><br/><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br/>Since it launched in November 2022, Goat Simulator 3 has been a completely stupid game.

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Preface:<br/><br/>"Main Deity Space" is my first attempt at making a game in my life. Since I have zero programming knowledge and can't understand code, Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) with its Blueprint system provided me with the opportunity to try my hand at creating a game that I love. I am extremely grateful to UE5 engine for this.<br/><br/>During the development process, I conducted testing by releasing a game full of bugs on the Steam platform. I received a lot of help from player friends who patiently tested the game and provided suggestions. I am truly, truly thankful for their support.<br/><br/>The version currently online is still very basic, with professions, skills, equipment, materials, enemies, and maps continuously being added. The game itself definitely has many issues, and I hope everyone can understand and provide feedback so that I can make continuous improvements and adjustments.<br/><br/>After the official version is released, the testing version will not be canceled and will continue to be updated. However, the official version will be given priority for updates, with the testing version being updated once a month. <br/><br/>Apart from the difference in update timing, the leaderboards between the two versions will not be connected, and the testing version will not participate in future reward activities. However, there will be no difference in gameplay and content between the two versions.<br/><br/>For those who are willing to support me, you can purchase the official version, and I am sincerely grateful for your support.<br/><br/>Below is the introduction to the game itself:<br/><br/>"Main Deity Space" is a small game inspired by games like "Vampire Survivors" and "Diablo".<br/>The main theme is killing monsters, farming equipment, leveling up, drawing cards, farming materials, crafting equipment, upgrading followers, collecting pets, and so on.<br/><br/>Accidentally traversing into the realm of the Main Deity, embark on an endless cycle of slaughter. Strengthen yourself and your companions continuously through the trials initiated by the Main Deity.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B1.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>Through trials, safely returning to the Main Deity's space allows you to initiate new trials and face new challenges. The rewards become more abundant with higher difficulties, but in the event of death, all gains will be lost. Upon a safe return, you can bring back the rewards obtained during the trials—currency, equipment, materials, and more. The Main Deity's space also facilitates the exchange of various items, including gems, equipment, enhancement materials, and even skill upgrades.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B2.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>You can also craft various needed materials, totems, and even followers through the Main Deity.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B3.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>At the same time, the Main Deity also provides a storage vault, allowing you to save items before embarking on an adventure. After all, if you cannot survive, you won't be able to bring back any items.<br/>With the rich experience gained in battles, you will level up and acquire attribute points that can be allocated to strengthen attributes such as strength, life, mana, speed, and more. You will also earn skill points to upgrade skills as needed.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B4.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>During the trial process, you can obtain or craft companions with different characteristics to assist you in battle. They are powerful and can also be upgraded with equipment and skills. They will engage in combat autonomously. Up to 5 different companions can coexist at the same time, providing the most powerful assistance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B5.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>Survive together with them!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE01_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG1.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG2.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE02_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG3.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE03_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG4.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE04_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE05_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG5.gif?t=1709230146"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							After experiencing a devastating car crash in the middle of the desert, you awaken stranded at a long-abandoned gas station. A voice on the radio calls out to you, trapped nearby but just out of reach. Together you discover remnants of a missing cult, unholy rituals, a mysterious cavern, and bloodthirsty creatures hunting you both down. With the walls closing in, can you follow in the cultist's footsteps and complete their final ritual -- <i>before it's too late?</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Lose Your Mind</h2>Witnessing horrors will chip away at your psyche, depicted by your Nerve meter. As you slowly lose touch with reality, audiovisual hallucinations and other unforeseen consequences will begin to manifest. The effects of a weakened mind are wide-ranging and completely unscripted - meaning any manner of horrors can happen at any time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight</h2>Face threats head-on with a wide variety of guns and melee weapons. From hammers, to nailguns, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, and much more. All weapons are able to be upgraded to fit your needs.<h2 class="bb_tag">Scavenge</h2>Discover valuable supplies hidden away in every corner of the world. Use them at-will, or break them down in to raw materials to be used in arcane transmutation. Collect recipes to unlock the ability to transmute these materials into completely new items.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hide</h2>Avoid dangers by keeping a low profile. Create distractions by making noise, or take to the shadows to remain unseen. Flip switches or shoot out lights to gain the element of surprise, or power them all on to see what's lurking in the darkness.<h2 class="bb_tag">Run</h2>Escape your pursuers with a mixture of both agility and ingenuity. Vault over barricades, slide under obstacles, and climb anything to put distance between you and imminent death.<h2 class="bb_tag">Improvise</h2>No key for that door? Find a hole in the wall. Break a window. Crawl through a hatch. Climb up a pipe. Every encounter is designed with numerous solutions in mind, further multiplied by emergent systems allowing for completely new ways to tackle problems.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Enjoy 3 unique slot games. paragon Slots offer you a classic game of slots with a dark fantasy theme. Line up three or more symbols from left to right to win cash or even bonus games. Match the featured symbols to view each of the games characters and their party. Based on the now classic slot machines of the mid 2000s era!<h2 class="bb_tag">New To Slots?</h2><br/>The goal of slots is to match 3 or more of the same symbol to win. The first reel is the most important because you must match symbols from left to right starting with the first reel.<br/><br/>There are four main symbols that win big amounts, some basic symbols based on a deck of cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten) that can win medium amounts and there are also three special symbols which we will explain below.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Wild_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Wild:</strong> The Wild symbol can match any other symbol in the game (except other special symbols)<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Scatter_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Scatter:</strong> The Scatter symbol is special because you can win just by having three or more of them on the screen in any position (hence the name scatter because they can be scattered about the reels).<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Bonus_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you get three bonus symbols you enter a bonus game where you win free spins and keep all the winnings from enjoying those spins.<h2 class="bb_tag">Other Options</h2><br/><strong>Lines:</strong> There are three obvious lines you can match symbols on across the play area, but you can also match symbols on lines that aren't as obvious. By clicking the lines button you can see the lines being checked for matching symbols.<br/><br/><strong>Denominations:</strong> You can choose to play a penny per line or $10 per line each spin.<br/><br/><strong>Bet: </strong>The bet multiplier is how many coins based on your denomination you want to bet on each line per spin.<br/><br/><strong><i>Example: </i></strong>If your denomination is set to 1 cent, your bet multiplier is set to 1 and you are playing 20 lines per spin, each spin will cost 20 cents a spin [1x1x20].<h2 class="bb_tag">SPECIAL FEATURES - Slot Cabinet Owners<br/>CONTROLLER SUPPORT</h2><br/>Being a slots enthusiasts with real slot machines we have noticed that there is no software out there designed to work in a slot cabinet (or PC for that matter) that feel like the real slot machines (they always have extra user interface stuff on the screen that ruins the real feel of the slot game). So we made this software to fill that gap and intend to make many more (adult and non-adult) based slot games.<br/><br/>We have a special feature for slot cabinet builders / owners. We've included the ability to use a USB joypad encoder to play the games using a real slot machines buttons. The games fit a Ceronix type monitor at 1280x 1024 perfectly and feel like a real slot machine. 4:3 and 16:9 screen modes supported. We plan to add more cabinet features in future updates. If you have an old non-working slot machine or even a working slot machine with a multiple input monitor (many are, you should check) You can put a cheap computer into your slot cabinet and have the best of both worlds!<br/><br/>If you are playing on your PC, in a real Slot Cabinet, or building your own slot machine.. we have you covered and want to help make it a simple and fun project!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/USB_Controller.png?t=1709217142"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fk2N3rpRuB3" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/fc521c8bf21bff775962df4f130bb74eb5577a46.png?t=1709215291"/></a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif01.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders is an action-adventure RPG with base-building elements, where you take on the role of a classic hero who stands up to the tyranny and injustice that haunts Sherwood. As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
