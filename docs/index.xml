<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/the-inquisitor-intro.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/><strong>The Inquisitor</strong> is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church.<br/><br/>You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/BeTheUltimate_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/be-the-ultimate-holy-judge-and-jury.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/MorallyTainted_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/morally-tainted-non-linear-tale.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/EnlightenedSleuthing_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/enlightened-sleuthing.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/DelveInto_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/delve-into-the-unworld.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/Persuasive_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/persuasive-interrogations.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/LetYourSword_EN.png?t=1707415647"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1880470/extras/let-your-sword-do-the-talking.gif?t=1707415647"><br/><br/>Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Other recommended games from Kalypso Media</h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1287840/Disciples_Liberation/" id="dynamiclink_1" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1287840/Disciples_Liberation/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>There was something rotten in that old hospital. You were just following your instincts that night. But, it was your pride that killed those people, including your partner on the force. With nothing to exonerate you, on a temporary insanity defense, they threw the book at you.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/bookatyou.png?t=1707404050"/></h2><br/>For ten years, you were haunted by unanswered questions, frightened by what you saw, and what you did. Now you’re scraping by as a private eye, operating out of a crummy apartment. One day, a strange case comes along, giving you an opportunity to clear your name once and for all. With your sanity at stake and rent to pay, how can you refuse?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/stepintoshoes2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Solve a wide variety of mysteries as Pinnacle City's cheapest Private Eye! From missing pets to murder investigations, your detective skills will either earn you fortune or face punches. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/explorepc2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Home to a wretched hive of scum and villainy, Pinnacle City is littered with black market trade, grafters, and players of all kinds. From the shadowy alleys of The Sprawl to the sleek skyscrapers of Uptown, each district holds its own charm and mysteries to uncover! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/castchars2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Each member of your entourage has their own distinctive personality and skill set. Some will follow you into battle. Others will try and undermine you. Who will you choose for your lineup and will they be with you until the bitter end?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/epiccombos2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Bad guys can jump out at you from anywhere and each gang in Pinnacle City has its own devastating attacks! But you can beat 'em back in turn-based combat using timed hits and blocks to increase or reduce damage. You can also partner with your entourage members to unleash devastating combo attacks!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/readsomething2.png?t=1707404050"><br/>Manuscripts teach entourage members a wide variety of skills. Learned skills can then be upgraded by skill points you get from solving major cases. With each upgrade, skills become more powerful, and your entourage can take on even more powerful enemies. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/gearup2.png?t=1707404050"><br/>Tune up your gear with modifications to fit your play style. Experiment with different mods and ammo types to deal varying types of damage and inflict status effects on enemies. Whether you prefer a technical approach or go in guns blazing, modifying your gear is key as you battle your way through the city.<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FRUtWc3RFJs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/Copy_of_Join_the_discord!__1080_×_1000_px___3_.gif?t=1707404050"/></a></img></img></img></img></img></img></strong> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Conor's first three visual novels have been rereleased in one package! See the world through the eyes of a lonely man talking a walk, try to escape from a secluded prison, or help a girl confess to her crush. While one on them is a kinetic visual novel, there won't be any choices to make, but the other two will have a big impact on the world the characters are in.<br/><br/><u>They Cannot Hear Me</u><br/>It's the middle on winter and a lonely man goes for a walk late at night. He spends the time thinking about how sad his life has become and how things will likely never change for the better for him. Will anything interesting happen on his walk or is he doomed to spend the rest of his life alone? As he walks around town he'll be reminded of events from his past. The man in the story doesn't have a name because it's not really important, so you can assume it to be whatever you want. Since this is a short kinetic visual novel there really isn't much else to say. There are no choices, it's just a really short story.<br/><br/><u>Trapped</u><br/>When you wake up in a prison cell, you have no memory of who you are or how you even got there. If you don't want to rot to death, it's up to you to find a way out and explore the island you've been trapped on with a girl you'll meet outside named Mila. Like you, she has no idea how she got to the island or what's going on. If you want to get out of there, both of you are going to have to work to together to escape! If you're not careful, your choices could lead to your death or you'll just have to die of old age alone. Whichever comes first.<br/><br/><u>The Weird One</u><br/>Camille has made up her mind and plans to confess her feelings to a friend of hers. However, what she doesn't know is that this guy is much weirder than she thinks. Whatever choices she makes will have a huge effect on whatever universe she's in. Some decisions may allow her to continue to have a normal life but others will throw her in all kinds of weird situations. Will Camille be able to tell Dave how he she feels about him or will he drag him into whatever weird things are going on with him?<br/><br/>All of these stories aren't very long which is way they've been bundled together in one collection.						</div></div>]]></description>

							This is a puzzle game where you aim to clear levels by fitting ice blocks into holes.<br>
It's a simple operation that involves moving blocks on the field up, down, left, or right, but as the level increases, the difficulty becomes more and more challenging.<br>
The ice block will continue to slide until it hits an obstacle, so it's important to think about how you can stop it at the desired point.<br>
There is no element of luck or action, so it is recommended for people who simply enjoy solving puzzles.						</br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Hoverkitty in the Hoververse Chapter Three is the third game in the Hoverkitty in the Hoververse series. The Hoververse series is about a robotic cat traveling around a planet called the Hoververse, protecting it and the creatures that live within the world from the clutches of malicious entities.<br>
<br>
In this 3D game, you can explore the land, and soon you will find that there is something amiss, something that could upend the Hoververse. Things are not as they should be, and it is up to our unlikely, yet valiant hero and heroine to put things back in order and bring peace back to the Hoververse. <br>
<br>
For the first time in the series, you can discover the mysterys of the Hoververse as either Hoverkitty or Hoverflea, which means you have multiple ways of completing a level. Hoverkitty is a robotic cat that can wield a sword for close combat, and Hoverflea is a robotic flea that shoots lasers for skirmishes that can be fought further away. <br>
<br>
A quest that you will find in most levels is Treat collecting. Sometimes you must collect Treats to pass a level.  Hoverkitty and Hoverflea can both collect Treats, but one advantage to playing as Hoverflea is that he is smaller than Hoverkitty, which means he can fit in smaller areas.  <br/>
<br/>
This has aspects of an adventure,3D, first-person shooter. You will meet old enemies, such as the Hoverkitty Hunters, and also new allies that can help you in the Battle for the Hoververse.<br/>
<br/>
This game also has some lore to it, for all you  Hoverkitty fans out there, so be on the look out for some new an old faces and facts.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
