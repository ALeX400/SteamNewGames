<h2>About This Content</h2>
							The Survivors are desperate to hunt vampires, but are running out of places to look. Only one option remains: Be the bullet hell... in space! <br/><br/>Gather your most trusted Crewmates, prepare to eject the Impostors, and try to survive while mowing down thousands of extra-terrestrial foes in this expansion for Vampire Survivors. Turn classic Among Us tasks into outrageous weapons, upgrading your abilities after every roguelite run to overcome impossible odds with ease. Be alert to subterfuge as you explore the vast weirdness of the Polus Replica and keep your wits about you, as suspicious eyes are always watching üëÄ.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features <strong>20-in-game only</strong> unlocks, no Steam achievements.

Dino is a jack-of-all-trades who boosts stats whenever a task is completed (i.e. when you level up a weapon). <br/><br/>Engineer Gino - Few Crewmates come as close to truly competent task-work as Gino, who offers a selection of passive weapons from their toolbox every few levels. <br/><br/>Ghost Lino - Good Crewmates don't let a silly thing like death get in the way of their tasks. Lino can float through walls at will and can't be hurt, but can't deal damage either... what could be the goal of such suspicious game design?! <br/><br/>Shapeshifter Nino - Look at this bean! They can do all kinds of... wait, where did they go? And where did this snowman come from? Oh well, I'm sure you'll figure it out. <br/><br/>Guardian Pina - Everyone needs an angel on their shoulder. Pina isn't just there for moral support, though - they boost the defences of all nearby allies, and they love taking out the garbage. <br/><br/>Impostor Rina - A fellow Crewmate that is in no way some kind of duplicitous, well-disguised killer. One hundred percent all-natural-bean, right here. Nothing to see or think about. <br/><br/>Scientist Mina - Mina's scientific skill is matched only by their intense clumsiness. Thankfully, dropping potentially hazardous chemicals has a major upside when you're besieged by extra-terrestrial monsters. <br/><br/>Horse - It's a horse. Neigh, etc. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Weapons_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/WeaponIcons.png?t=1702898514"><br/>Transform your tasks into powerful weapons to defend yourself from Impostors, Shapeshifters, and all manner of extra-terrestrial weirdos. Blast away baddies with the supermassive sound waves of your Report! weapon, slice angry aliens in half with Lucky Swipe, and drop duplicitous foes to their doom with Just Vent. Lonely Survivors should seek out Mini Crewmates to empower their Task-based weaponry (or just for general companionship). <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Stage_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/>Polus Replica - an eerily accurate replica of the scientific base on Polus. This planet is packed with bizarre biomes ripe for exploration by Survivors and Crewmates, with tasks and treasure chests galore. Unfortunately, its also accidentally being invaded by your average space dwellers, like aliens, robots, and ducks. Expect the unexpected and do NOT trust the bins. Never trust the bins. Or the chicken nuggets. In fact, it's a good idea to remain alert at all times and not trust anything. <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/StageMap.png?t=1702898514"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Tracks_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/>‚ô´ Emergency Meeting<br/>‚ô´ Hide and Survive<br/>‚ô´ No Ducks Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Aliens Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Ghosts Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Vampires Among Us						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sue√±os ‚Äì The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sue√±os area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sue√±os is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. ‚ÄúThe city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,‚Äù states Chief Galo √Ålvarez. ‚ÄúIn a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.‚Äù <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sue√±os, Chief √Ålvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‚ÄòJudge‚Äô Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
‚ÄúThis assignment is not for the faint of heart,‚Äù comments Commander Beaumont, ‚ÄúExtremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography‚Ä¶ the world of policing in Los Sue√±os is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn‚Äôt necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.‚Äù <br>
<br>
The Los Sue√±os Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù Beaumont‚Äôs updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sue√±os or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we‚Äôve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team‚Äôs mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn‚Äôt limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you‚Äôll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy ‚Äì a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end ‚Äì but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							An arcade game styled after classic titles of the first generation of consoles. Gameplay set in the cybernetic sphere, accompanied by electronic music matching the game's visuals.<br>
You are the result of a project code-named O---O, an alter-ego, a mechanical expression of your soul particle. You travel through the corridors of digital reality in order to annihilate the enemy of the system.<br>
The main rule of the game is not to die. Each time the core comes into contact with an object, you are destroyed, which means you return to the last checkpoint. The number of lives for each location is limited.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Immerse yourself in a dystopian world where humanity, as a result of its actions, has brought the planet to the brink of contamination. You live in a city built above the clouds of radioactive dust, devoid of a sense of purpose, participating in yet another "Groundhog Day" of the main character. Your task is to descend beneath the surface of the city to repair the autonomous system that ensures the functioning of the city's inhabitants. Is it just another routine malfunction, or will today be the day that changes you forever? It's time to answer the question of what your path and truth are.<br>
<br>
Hand-drawn graphics<br>
One of the unique features of our game is hand-drawn graphics. In the age of artificial intelligence, games created from AI-generated assets and photos, we have prepared hand-drawn graphics, scenes, and animations that create a unique atmosphere in Lazarus. An exceptional game deserves exceptional visuals, and Lazarus delivers just that. Your gameplay is the result of a significant amount of our time and energy. After all, what wouldn't we do for a loyal player?<br>
<br>
Immerse yourself in the game atmosphere<br>
We have prepared a approximately 2-hour-long story written in a language that allows you to enter the body and mind of the main character. You will encounter both childish, humorous conversations and internal dialogues, as well as a serious quest for the meaning of life and purpose in this world.<br>
<br/>
Make choices<br/>
Make choices that will impact the further gameplay. Do you believe in the butterfly effect? If so, you have the option to experience it firsthand during the gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Different layers of gameplay<br/>
You can experience the game on different levels, allowing you to play it multiple times without feeling bored. It's not obvious at first glance, so if you're looking for something more in games, you will find a hidden message and a parallel story here. This doesn't mean you can't focus solely on the main storyline of the game and interpret it literally. That's one of the magical elements of Lazarus.<br/>
<br/>
Achievements<br/>
Achievement Hunter, we have prepared Achievements that will enrich your collection. Of course, not all of them will be easy to obtain. In the end, you will be able to compare yourself in this regard against other players in "Lazarus a.d. 2222". Are you up for the challenge of unlocking all the Achievements?<br/>
<br/>
Mini-games<br/>
At certain moments, it's worth taking a break from the main story and playing mini-games that add variety to the gameplay. Show off your wit, agility, and logical thinking by playing mini-games.<br/>
<br/>
Gamepad support<br/>
In Lazarus, you can play with a gamepad. If you have played with a gamepad, let us know if you enjoyed the game's controls on it.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

So, what is the pattern of strings accepted by this automaton?<h2 class="bb_tag">Two Major Updates</h2>We're making the game even more challenging and fun by introducing two major updates:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A state can be both beginning and accepting.<br/></li><li>Some challenges require you to create a deterministic automaton (thanks for the suggestions from players), which means:<br/> <ul class="bb_ul"> <li>There is at most one begin state.<br/> </li><li>Empty edges are not allowed, i.e., each edge must contain at least one character.<br/> </li><li>For a character, a state can transit to at most one state, i.e., no conflict edges.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul>Besides, we add red spots to denote each challenge's difficulty so that you can take your own route through the challenges.						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Logo.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><br/>Triadino is a casual puzzle game inspired by Tetris and Rock-Paper-Scissors. This game is played with randomly generated triplets (triominos) of three different types of blocks: Rock, Paper and Scissors. The unique interactions between different block types upon placement make the game more interesting and challenging.<br/><br/>Like in Tetris, the triomino generated in each turn will fall to the bottom of the game board, and the player can move and rotate the triomino so that it can be placed in a particular position and orientation upon reaching existing blocks.<br/><br/>However unlike in Tetris, upon placement on existing blocks, additional operations will take place between triomino blocks and the blocks below them. Based on the block types, the triomino blocks may cancel out or replace the blocks below them, and after block cancellation, the remaining block(s) may further fall down.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Placement.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><br/>Triadino has three game modes: Casual, Regular and Challenging, plus two leveling up modes: Line Clearing and Full Clearing. These modes determine the falling speed of the triominos and the speed increment when the game levels up. They also determine the number of rows of initial blocks generated in the Full Clearing level up mode.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Solo.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><br/>Triadino can be played in either the single player (Solo) mode or the double player (Dual) mode. The Dual mode can be played by two players on the same computer with a shared screen, or on different computers within the same intranet. The Dual mode has two sub-modes: Parallel and Adversarial. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Dual.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><br/>Triadino supports two types of computer players: Easy and Hard. One can choose to play against a computer player, or let one computer player to play by itself, or let two computer players to play against each other just for fun.<br/><br/>Enjoy the game! Also the game provides a number of nicely animated backgrounds for you to enjoy!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Animation_Plankton.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Animation_Ribbon.gif?t=1703049476"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Animation_Reflection.gif?t=1703049476"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You Got Crabs is a relaxing crab simulator that allows you to watch, and care for, crabs in different settings.<br>
<br>
Crabs<br>
Crabs are simple creatures. They require food and space to live, but not much else. They will roam around, eat plants or animals and breed with each other. Watch them grow and live their lives, or intervene with toys and new foods which can be found in crates that wash ashore.<br>
<br>
Evolution<br>
The crabs will evolve and their changes will affect their life cycles. The evolutionary processes are displayed by the color of the crab. A crab that has more red or orange will likely be able to handle heat better than a blue crab, for example. These traits are passed on to offspring, so they are able to adapt over time to changing environments. In the game, the player is able to modify the environments to force these changes.<br>
<br/>
Food<br/>
These particular crabs love to eat plants, particularly their specially formulated berries, but over time they may develop a taste for meat. If they do they will feast on the bodies of other dead crabs. If they never reach cannibalism, however, they may begin nibbling on the stalks that grow their special berries to gain extra nutrients. Be careful that they don't destroy the crop.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
