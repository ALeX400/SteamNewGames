You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							It was once your grandfather’s pride-and-joy, but your family ranch has fallen on hard times and it’s up to you to turn things around. Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_DemolishGIF.gif?t=1702984150"><h2 class="bb_tag">Rebuild Your Ranch</h2><br/>The years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs you’ll need to keep them safe and secure.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_ChickensGIF.gif?t=1702984150"><h2 class="bb_tag">Look After Your Livestock</h2><br/>Grand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? That’ll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work.<br/><br/>Expand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_HuntingGIF.gif?t=1702984150"><h2 class="bb_tag">Head Out on the Hunt</h2><br/>There’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you aren’t the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood. Sometimes your steady hand and sharp eyes will also be needed back on the ranch to stop hungry wolves turning your off-grid dream into a nightmare.<br/><br/>Play the game PCGamesN calls "House Flipper meets Red Dead Redemption 2"!						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong><u>Summary</u></strong><br/>-Pilot spaceships and lead an entire fleet.<br/>-Configure ship weapons, thrusters and modules.<br/>-Survive a hostile galaxy by fighting, mining, trading, crafting, exploring, doing missions and improving your fleet.<br/>-Colonize planets, moons and stations to expand your domain and increase your tax revenue.<br/>-Three different game modes:  campaign, custom and scenario.<br/>-Map editor included for creating your own mods and scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><u><strong>Game Modes</strong></u><br/>Cosmic Armada is an action-packed space combat and exploration game that takes you on a journey from refugee to galactic conqueror.<br/><br/>There are three different game modes: campaign, custom game, and scenario.  The game includes a map editor which allows you to create scenarios and mods.<br/><br/>In the campaign, you start out as a refugee who's home planet has just been conquered by the tyrannical Solar Empire.  You and your fellow refugees must struggle to survive, take back your homeworld and get revenge against the empire.  Each new campaign includes a procedurally generated galaxy that will be different each time you start a new game.<br/><br/>In custom game mode, you must conquer the capitals of all your archenemies.  At the beginning of the game, you select which factions you want to play with and who your archenemies are.  The game will create a procedurally generated galaxy for each new custom game.<br/><br/>In scenario mode, you can play any scenarios created in the map editor or downloaded from the workshop.<br/><br/><u><strong>Manage Your Fleet</strong></u><br/>One ship won't be enough to survive in a very dangerous galaxy.  You must build a fleet of ships in order to withstand the attacks from the Solar Empire, the Hex AI, the alien Vurgak Empire, and various criminal organizations.<br/><br/>As you earn money doing missions or selling the items you mine, craft or steal, you will be able to purchase ships at shipyards across the galaxy.  You can also add ships to your fleet by boarding and capturing enemy or derelict ships.<br/><br/>You control the lead ship of your fleet directly, and the rest of the ships in your fleet follow it.  Different fleet formations are available to control the overall behavior of your other ships.  If you wish to pilot a different ship in your fleet, you can easily switch to it in the fleet panel, and the rest of the fleet will follow that ship instead.<br/><br/><u><strong>Upgrade Your Ships</strong></u><br/>Each ship can be modified at mechanic shops across the galaxy.  Weapons, thrusters and modules can be added or removed at the mechanic shop.  The mechanic shops will also sell these items and repair your ships if they are damaged.  When ships are destroyed, they sometimes drop weapons, thrusters or modules that can be picked up.<br/><br/><u><strong>Build and Upgrade Colonies</strong></u><br/>You begin with one small colony that can't provide much, so upgrading your colony and founding new ones is essential.  Each colony can provide tax income to fund your fleet operations, a place to repair and refuel your fleet, a place to store your items, markets to trade, shipyards to buy ships, and more.  The more and bigger colonies you have, the larger fleet you can afford.  The crew on all your ships needs to be paid, so larger fleets will cost more and will require more income to support.<br/><br/>To upgrade your colonies, you can construct various buildings that provide different functions.  Each building will require resources to build.  These resources can be purchased from other factions or manufactured using factories, smelters and raw resources that can be mined from asteroids.<br/><br/><u><strong>Mining, Crafting and Trade</strong></u><br/>Your ship can be equipped with mining lasers to mine resources from asteroids.  These resources can be sold or used to manufacture more valuable items.  Crafting is done automatically by factories and smelters which can be built at any colony you own.  All you have to do is select the item to manufacture and make sure the required ingredients are in the colony inventory.  These items can be used to construct buildings or traded at markets across the galaxy.<br/><br/><u><strong>Piracy</strong></u><br/>Surviving the galaxy is challenging, and you may be forced to use nefarious means to get what you want.  You may have to hunt for bounties, board ships, steal ships, steal money or smuggle goods.  Cloaking devices and powerful weapons are essential for those willing to get involved in the underworld.<br/><br/><u><strong>Missions</strong></u><br/>The campaign includes a series of tutorial and story missions that must be completed in order to win the game and make it into the high score list.<br/><br/>In addition to story missions, each colony has its own HQ which gives out random missions the player can complete for money.  These non-story missions are available in the campaign, custom games and scenarios.<br/><br/>For scenarios, the scenario creators can create their own story mission series in the map editor.<br/><br/><u><strong>Map Editor and Modding</strong></u><br/>The built-in map editor allows players to create their own scenarios and mods.  A custom galaxy can be created which includes new stars, planets, moons, stations, missions, and more.  Mods allow players to modify ships, weapons, thrusters, modules, fleets and factions.  Each scenario can be combined with any number of mods.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							An arcade game styled after classic titles of the first generation of consoles. Gameplay set in the cybernetic sphere, accompanied by electronic music matching the game's visuals.<br>
You are the result of a project code-named O---O, an alter-ego, a mechanical expression of your soul particle. You travel through the corridors of digital reality in order to annihilate the enemy of the system.<br>
The main rule of the game is not to die. Each time the core comes into contact with an object, you are destroyed, which means you return to the last checkpoint. The number of lives for each location is limited.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Immerse yourself in a dystopian world where humanity, as a result of its actions, has brought the planet to the brink of contamination. You live in a city built above the clouds of radioactive dust, devoid of a sense of purpose, participating in yet another "Groundhog Day" of the main character. Your task is to descend beneath the surface of the city to repair the autonomous system that ensures the functioning of the city's inhabitants. Is it just another routine malfunction, or will today be the day that changes you forever? It's time to answer the question of what your path and truth are.<br>
<br>
Hand-drawn graphics<br>
One of the unique features of our game is hand-drawn graphics. In the age of artificial intelligence, games created from AI-generated assets and photos, we have prepared hand-drawn graphics, scenes, and animations that create a unique atmosphere in Lazarus. An exceptional game deserves exceptional visuals, and Lazarus delivers just that. Your gameplay is the result of a significant amount of our time and energy. After all, what wouldn't we do for a loyal player?<br>
<br>
Immerse yourself in the game atmosphere<br>
We have prepared a approximately 2-hour-long story written in a language that allows you to enter the body and mind of the main character. You will encounter both childish, humorous conversations and internal dialogues, as well as a serious quest for the meaning of life and purpose in this world.<br>
<br/>
Make choices<br/>
Make choices that will impact the further gameplay. Do you believe in the butterfly effect? If so, you have the option to experience it firsthand during the gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Different layers of gameplay<br/>
You can experience the game on different levels, allowing you to play it multiple times without feeling bored. It's not obvious at first glance, so if you're looking for something more in games, you will find a hidden message and a parallel story here. This doesn't mean you can't focus solely on the main storyline of the game and interpret it literally. That's one of the magical elements of Lazarus.<br/>
<br/>
Achievements<br/>
Achievement Hunter, we have prepared Achievements that will enrich your collection. Of course, not all of them will be easy to obtain. In the end, you will be able to compare yourself in this regard against other players in "Lazarus a.d. 2222". Are you up for the challenge of unlocking all the Achievements?<br/>
<br/>
Mini-games<br/>
At certain moments, it's worth taking a break from the main story and playing mini-games that add variety to the gameplay. Show off your wit, agility, and logical thinking by playing mini-games.<br/>
<br/>
Gamepad support<br/>
In Lazarus, you can play with a gamepad. If you have played with a gamepad, let us know if you enjoyed the game's controls on it.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

In this game, you will play with the simplest automaton model, Finite State Automaton, and use it to cope with 40 challenges from variants of the previous episode, character string manipulation, computer science, and mathematics.<br/><br/>If you are unfamiliar with Finite State Automaton, We highly recommend playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2629030" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2629030</a> first or learning Finite State Automaton online in advance.  <br/><br/><u>The criterion for judging whether it is suitable to play this game is whether you can answer the following question</u>:<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2681980/extras/aaauto.jpg?t=1703074122"><br/>The above picture shows a finite-state automaton. The first state with two colors denotes that it is both a beginning and accepting state. So, what is the pattern of strings accepted by this automaton?<h2 class="bb_tag">Two Major Updates</h2>We're making the game even more challenging and fun by introducing two major updates:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A state can be both beginning and accepting.<br/></li><li>Some challenges require you to create a deterministic automaton (thanks for the suggestions from players), which means:<br/> <ul class="bb_ul"> <li>There is at most one begin state.<br/> </li><li>Empty edges are not allowed, i.e., each edge must contain at least one character.<br/> </li><li>For a character, a state can transit to at most one state, i.e., no conflict edges.<br/> </li></ul></li></ul>Besides, we add red spots to denote each challenge's difficulty so that you can take your own route through the challenges.						</img></div></div>]]></description>
