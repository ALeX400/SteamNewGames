<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2299660/extras/wishlist_now.gif?t=1708374566"><br/><strong>Dinosaur-themed survival horror set in a flooded underground base. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Wishlist today!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>In this thrilling first-person horror shooter, you will play Jack Allen, as he investigates the mysterious Alaskan Sierra Research Facility, now flooded with water, which has been overrun by deadly dinosaurs. You will have to put your skills to the test as you embark on a heart-pumping, 12-hour journey through flooded tunnels, puzzle-filled bunkers, and dark corners filled with jump scares. The base has a dynamic sandbox layout where players can revisit areas, get upgrades to their weapons, and clear sections to create safe zones by draining water in the flooded sections. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2299660/extras/RaptorHeadShot.gif?t=1708374566"><br/><br/>Use a massive arsenal of deadly weapons to bring the pain!

Much of the base has been flooded with seawater. Jack Allen is part of an expedition sent out to investigate the Sierra disaster. But when their boat gets attacked by a Megalodon, the crew becomes shipwrecked on the shores of Sierra and must find a way to escape. <br/><br/>As a member of this team, you will delve into the dark secrets of the facility and uncover the truth behind the Dino outbreak. With a gripping narrative and heart-pumping action, <i>Fossilfuel 2</i> will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The game has a heavy focus on underwater horror and has a massive cast of dinosaurs including Utahraptor and Spinosaurus.<h2 class="bb_tag">Nonlinear Replay Value:</h2>With a wide range of weapons and challenging AI, each encounter with the Dinosaurs will be unique. In <i>Fossilfuel 2</i>, no two playthroughs are the same. The game features <strong>multiple endings</strong> and <strong>player choices</strong> that change the course of the game. And with 12 hours of intense horror action, you will want to come back and play again and again to experience all the thrills this game has to offer.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The latest installment in the Spirit Hunter series.<br>
Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II is a suspense-horror game set at a prestigious academy.<br>

Notices that announce people’s deaths, and students who aren’t what they seem. Through your investigation, it appears that a spirit called “The Departed” is the mastermind behind it all, and it looks like it wants something from you...<br>
<br>
This entry introduces a new side-scrolling function when traveling across different locations. Combined with the first-person perspective during investigations, the Spirit Hunter experience is more immersive and terrifying than ever.<br>
<br>
The partnering system has also been enhanced. The success rate of your actions during “Suspensive Acts” change depending on your partner of choice, further elevating the elements of suspense in this installment.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, what do you mean we’re moving?!</h2>Just great; just when Inco was getting ready to move on into his Senior year, his parents decide to uproot his life and move half-way across the country!<br/><br/>Guess it’s time to start all over. Sure, Inco didn’t have many friends (or any) back at his old school, and sure, he was so low on the social ladder that he had to get a deep-sea diving lesson…. Wait, why was he complaining about moving again?<br/><br/>I Wani Hug that Gator is a multi-ended, choices-matter visual novel about second chances and the power of accepting who you are. Shape how Inco makes the most of his final year, and how the relationships he makes along the way will develop. One relationship in particular has him feeling all fuzzy inside…<h2 class="bb_tag">The Prehistoric Romance a Million-and-One Years in the making!</h2>If there’s one good thing to come out of Inco’s sudden relocation, it’s Olivia. Bold and brash, Olivia seems particularly gifted in getting under Inco’s skin. No matter how Inco slices it, he and Olivia seem destined to go together like a particularly scaly sandwich. But the outcome of such a pairing is yet to be determined…<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, am I being graded on this?!</h2>Make friends, reconcile enemies, and figure out how Inco could possibly repair his miserable excuse for a social life.  But be warned: The choices you make expands the relationships with Inco’s classmates and determines which of the four unique endings you receive. Maybe Inco should’ve spent a little less time studying and a bit more time learning how to relate to people…						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Embark on an electrifying odyssey through ancient world in "Samurai`s Way", the inaugural title from TinC Studio that merges the relentless thrill of a 2D runner with the strategic depth of a clicker arcade. Drawing inspiration from the storied philosophy of the samurai way, this game invites players to step into the sandals of a novice warrior, forged in the spirit of Bushido, on an epic quest for honor and enlightenment.<br>
<br>
As the dawn mist settles over the emerald hills of ancient world, our hero, a young samurai named Kenji, finds himself on a path filled with perils and revelations. Disillusioned by the tyranny corrupting his homeland, Kenji embarks on a relentless journey, seeking wisdom and the strength to bring peace to his people. His travels are not just a test of skill but a spiritual trial to uphold the virtues of Rectitude, Courage, Benevolence, Respect, Honesty, Honor, and Loyalty, which are the pillars of his warrior soul.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ATTENTION ALL FUTURE EMPLOYEES! Omnibullet Inc. is now hiring!</strong></h2>Does your current desk job bore you? Are you ready to charge up your career? Have you always wanted to build sophisticated tower systems to shoot batteries with energy bullets?<br/><br/>To streamline its battery factory production, our company is looking for a Production Line Architect. Your primary task? Make sure the charging process runs smoothly.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/nice_system.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Responsibilities</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Design and implement efficient battery charging systems.<br/></li><li> Innovate and solve complex puzzles on dozens of diverse production lines.<br/></li><li> Recycle energy bullets to earn the company Eco Credits.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Benefits</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Unique job description: a mixture of puzzle, automation, and tower defense.<br/></li><li> Creative freedom: solve the production lines your own way.<br/></li><li> Chance to work with a revolutionary tower charging system: only one tower shoots, and the others transform the bullets.<br/></li><li> Time is not a limit: Rewind and fast-forward to any production phase and work at your own tempo.<br/></li><li> High safety standards: No employee, visitor, or other being gets hurt. (Violence-free)<br/></li><li> Procedural and customizable tower-generated soundtrack: Each tower system emits a characteristic melody.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Qualifications</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Proficient in puzzle-solving and automation techniques.<br/></li><li> Strong problem-solving skills with a creative approach to challenges.<br/></li><li> Proven track record in designing and optimizing production systems.<br/></li><li> Not afraid of free-flying bullets.<br/></li><li> Experience in tower defense or analogous strategic fields is a plus.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Battery charging process step by step</strong></h2>Our battery factory uses a revolutionary charging process: shooting the batteries with energy bullets. While this system entails some inherent risks, it has proven to be extremely efficient.<h2 class="bb_tag">Energizing and recycling bullets</h2>The <strong>Bullet Tower</strong> shoots basic bullets that don't carry much energy. It is, therefore, desirable to energize them in <strong>Energy Towers</strong> before they hit batteries. It is also useful to recycle bullets that do not hit any battery in the <strong>Eco Tower</strong>. This earns the company <strong>Eco Credits</strong> and keeps environmentalists at arm's length.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/charging.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Changing bullet direction</h2>Due to the complicated layouts of our factory floors, it is often necessary to change the bullet path to avoid an obstacle. This can be achieved by <strong>Bend Towers</strong> that change the bullet's direction by 90 degrees.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/bending.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Splitting bullets</h2>Building multiple <strong>Bullet Towers</strong> to increase the number of bullets in circulation can be quite expensive. So here's an alternative: <strong>Split Tower</strong> takes an already existing bullet on the input and splits it into three bullets with reduced energy.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/splitting.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Fusing bullets</h2>To create the most powerful bullets, it is necessary to utilize the <strong>Fuse Tower</strong> that fuses the energies of three incoming bullets into one. The combined bullet has very <strong>high energy</strong> and pierces through batteries instead of being destroyed. This way, only a fraction of the energy will be used for charging, and the rest will pierce through.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/fuse_and_pierce.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Routing bullets</h2>The <strong>Junction Tower</strong> is quite versatile and can be used in various situations. It can chain bullet streams, fuse them, and perform complex bullet-routing tasks. Furthermore, the routing direction can be switched when hit from the side with the lever.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/switching.gif?t=1708359897"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
