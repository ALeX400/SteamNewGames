<h2>About This Content</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Laughing_Kookaburra.gif?t=1702403167"><br/>In the adaptation of the award-winning Wingspan: Oceania Expansion embark on a journey through the breathtaking lands of Oceania. Learn about birds from around Australia and New Zealand and all-new resources and mechanics that will enrich your adventure of creating a wildlife preserve.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Cards.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>Attract nearly 100 new birds to your wildlife preserve</strong><br/>Birds from the Oceania region await you in the second expansion to Wingspan. Get to know them better with interesting facts written on cards and recordings of their real sounds. Many of them have brand new skills, including a yellow 'end game' ability that activates when the game is over.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Nectar.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>Feed your birds with new food - nectar</strong><br/>The digital version of Wingspan has never been sweeter! A new food type - nectar - will appear in your inventory. It is one of the most essential ingredients in the nutrition of the birds of Oceania. It’s also an excellent substitute for other types of food for birds from different parts of the world. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Emu.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>Take on new challenges</strong><br/>Along with new bird abilities, Oceania Expansion offers new bonus cards and end-of-round goals. Now you have to pay attention to more details: not only to the sets of birds and nests, and their wingspan but also to which way your bird's beak is facing on the card. There may also be times when a round has no end goal. All these challenges, and many more, will add variety to your subsequent games.<br/><br/><strong>New alternative player board</strong><br/>The player board now presents a new design and functionalities. You will find on it not only a place for your nectar but also options for resetting the bird feeder and card tray. The board also enables you to get more food and cards quicker than before while laying eggs is reduced. All these changes diversify the dynamics of the gameplay.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Count_Raggis_Bird_of_Paradise.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>Listen to some more relaxing music</strong><br/>In Wingspan: Oceania Expansion we continue to expand the game with new tracks composed by Paweł Górniak. Let yourself be carried away by a soothing soundtrack that will make the game even more enjoyable.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Background.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>New backgrounds and portraits inspired by Oceania</strong><br/>The beauty and diversity of Oceania have also inspired us to create picturesque backgrounds where you can play your games and portraits that relate to the local fauna. Choose your favourite graphics and get close to the nature of the continent.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1962870/extras/OE_Sulphur_Crested_Cockatoo.gif?t=1702403167"><br/><strong>Enjoy all the features of the base version of the game</strong><br/>With Wingspan: Oceania Expansion, you don't lose any of the features available in the basic version of the game, regardless of whether you also own the European Expansion. Play with friends in cross-platform multiplayer mode, test your skills in weekly challenges and play against Automa - now with additional bonus cards and new end-of-round goals.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962870" id="dynamiclink_3" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962870</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<br>
The first major story expansion is all about the Rogue Trader's voidship, the life of its crew, and the threats lurking in its holds. Dive into a new epic story integrated into the main narrative, battle new enemies, and recruit a new companion — a death cult assassin. Explore new decks of your voidship, unlock new upgrade options, and master the mechanics of void combat.

2. Lex Imperialis<br/>

As the past of House von Valancius begins to present itself in a new light, the Rogue Trader faces difficult decisions that may affect the future of the entire Koronus Expanse.<br/>
Over the course of this story, you will get a chance to learn more about the collection of the Imperial Tithe, otherwise known as the Grand Harvesting. Interfere with this fundamental process of the Imperium at your own peril. Discover new areas, game mechanics, and archetypes — and of course, encounter new horrors of the Immaterium.<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Works beautifully on Steam Deck!</h2><i>We're still waiting for Valve to officially verify A Highland Song for Steam Deck, but we've designed it from the ground up to work perfectly there. So if that's your preferred platform, you're in for a treat!</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Moira McKinnon is running away.</h2>To reach the sea, Moira must first cross the Scottish Highlands—a wilderness of paths, peaks, shortcuts, dangers, and song.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/waterfall-jump.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Platforming</h2>Climb peaks to orient yourself and plan your next steps. Spelunk caves, scale cliffs, jump from rock to rock and slide down scree slopes as you make your way forward.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/survival.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survival</h2>Wind, rain and cold are your enemies. Moira is no superhero, and the Highlands are not to be underestimated. Shelter to survive.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/ascend-peak-shorter.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Navigation</h2>Collect and position 100 map fragments to discover faster routes. The hills are crisscrossed with paths: some well-trodden, others hidden away.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/narrative.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Narrative</h2>Learn the stories and the secrets of the hills, which are filled with lost things, echoes, and memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/music-run-sunrise.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Rhythm runs</h2>Skip and jump through the valleys to the incredible music of TALISK and Fourth Moon. The landscape itself forms itself around the shape of the music.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/branching-paths.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Replay</h2>Get ready to make the journey more than once, because a single trip isn't nearly enough to discover the Highlands' deepest secrets.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/moira-and-deer.png?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>Moira McKinnon has never seen the sea. <br/><br/>For fifteen years she’s lived with her mum in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands—then one day she receives a letter from her Uncle Hamish urging her to come to the coast. If she can reach his lighthouse in time, a wonderful surprise will be waiting...<br/> <br/>And so, Moira runs away.<br/><br/>The hills are full of secrets and stories, but what you find will depend on where you go. The narrative is not branching but weaving; a mesh of history, mythology and family secrets. What truths will you discover? <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/zoom-to-lighthouse.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The World</h2>In the Highlands, every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song. Giants sleep, ghosts sing, crows carry messages, and eagles lift the dead. <br/><br/>But the Highlands’ crags are unforgiving and its summits are cold—Moira’s trek will not be easy. <br/><br/>Can you help her find a way across this winding wilderness in time?<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/talisk.jpg?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Music of the Highlands</h2>A Highland Song’s soundtrack is composed by Laurence Chapman alongside two multi-award-winning giants of the Scottish folk scene, TALISK and Fourth Moon. Royalty of the festival circuit, these two bands combine virtuosic instrumental playing with fast, inventive rhythms, to produce new tunes in traditional styles played with beauty, energy and swagger.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header_alt_assets_1.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1702402049"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher.

As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction.

Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Moving to a new home, you discover some oddities in the behavior of your unsociable neighbor from the house across the street.

It becomes clear that something suspicious is going on. You can not stay away - you need to get into the neighbor's house and find out what's happening inside! However, this will not be so easy to do! Each corner of his yard is adorned with a movable video camera, and all doors and windows are securely locked. And the neighbor himself is a rather dangerous person who will stop at nothing, just to hide all his dark deeds. If he discovers you, you are unlikely to be able to leave his house alive! Stay unnoticed, use your own ingenuity and uncover a terrible secret!<br>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This dance-interactive VR album contains six songs. Each song has 6 layers of pre-composed music, and when you flail with your hands the direction of the hand's movement switches to a different layer of music. Your gestures also interact with the environment, tossing out physics objects like lobsters or disco balls, or sometimes just lightning that glitches out anything it touches.<br>
<br>
With groundbreaking visuals that take advantage of stencil shaders to create portals and glitch effects, this album abandons realism and leans into the power of Virtual Reality to create a world impossible to replicate outside of a VR headset.<br>
<br>
There are no points in Rave Gazebo and you cannot play it wrong. There is no objective other than to play around remixing the music and interacting with the environment.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Long ago, the first star was born.<br>
<br>
On the night when the star was burning the brightest, any girl born under the light would be gifted the magic of the powers of the Star Goddess.<br>
<br>
Those girls were hunted and burned for holding such immense power. All except for one who was kept hidden in the forest by her mother.<br>
<br>
Seventeen years later... the first star has shattered scattering the chunks across the universe, one even landing in the kingdom of Lordell.<br/>
<br/>
A warlock seeking great power has taken over Lordell Castle and in one final effort the prince shattered it further into eight fragments, ordering the Maidens of the First Star to hide them deep within ancient temples around the kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
The last surviving witch, Verana wakes up to a voice,<br/>
<br/>
"Go find the fragments. Stop him. Save me. Please."<br/>
<br/>
PLAY as Verana, a young witch and master a variety of spells to slice, burn, and zap enemies in this 2D platforming adventure!<br/>
<br/>
DEFEAT bosses sealed away in forgotten dungeons to claim the scattered fragments of the shattered star and restore peace to the land!<br/>
<br/>
UPGRADE Verana's health and magic at Angel Maiden Statues by making hearty donations!<br/>
<br/>
EXPLORE a great forest, dark caves, sandy waste, and even quaint towns!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
