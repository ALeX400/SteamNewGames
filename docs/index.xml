      <title>The Sims™ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140610/The_Sims_4_For_Rent_Expansion_Pack/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2140610/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Build Residential Rental lots in any livable World with up to 6 units per lot and households of up to 8 Sims per unit. Choose to live as a tenant or property owner in The Sims™ 4 For Rent Expansion Pack. Your Sim can now own and manage multiple Residential Rental lots or move into a home where they’re closer to their neighbors than ever (perfect for snooping!). From potlucks to evictions, there’s a lot to do and a bustling new world to do it in. Purchase through January 18 to get bonus items** to bring the Night Market home for your Sims.<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Street Eats Digital Content</strong> — Bring night market flavor home with a grill cart, street umbrella, and fruit basket, available when you order from November 2 through January 18**.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>New Lot Type</strong> — New Residential Rental lots give you the chance to get creative with multi-family dwellings. Give your Sims a basement suite to rent out, a duplex to keep 2 families close, townhomes for multiple families, or even build apartments of up to 6 units (or more if you know the cheat). Each Residential Rental can be customized to your specifications.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Property Management</strong> — Property owner Sims can be present property managers, living among their tenants, or they can live in a separate residence while generating income from several property investments. If your Sim doesn’t want to manage the whole property, then perhaps the new Handyperson Career might be better suited to them. Property owners should keep their Unit Ratings high because, if they don’t, they could face consequences like a Tenant Revolt.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Closer Than Ever</strong> — Sims in Residential Rentals will inevitably get tangled up in each other’s lives. They’ll meet with other tenants at Social Events like a community potluck, in the garden, or other common areas at their Residential Rental, and have ample opportunity to discover their neighbor’s secrets by eavesdropping, snooping, or even breaking and entering. If you discover something juicy, you can blackmail other Sims for a bribe, too!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Bustling and Beautiful</strong> — One of the most iconic scenes Tomarang has to offer is the Night Market where your Sims will savor new foods and add unique objects such as the pressure cooker and electric kettle to their homes. As you explore the world, you might even see children playing new games of marbles and hopscotch or discover the 4 new traits and 4 new aspirations unique to For Rent.</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Gain access to the two upcoming major expansions for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader and save with the bundle price!<br>
<br>
1. Void Shadows<br>
(coming June 2024)<br>
<br>
The first major story expansion is all about the Rogue Trader's voidship, the life of its crew, and the threats lurking in its holds. Dive into a new epic story integrated into the main narrative, battle new enemies, and recruit a new companion — a death cult assassin. Explore new decks of your voidship, unlock new upgrade options, and master the mechanics of void combat. Meet new members of your crew on the bridge, such as the Astropath, the chirurgeon, and others.<br>
The events of this story will be reflected in the game's epilogue.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion offers 15 hours of gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Lex Imperialis<br/>
(coming December 2024)<br/>
<br/>
The second major story expansion sees the Lord Captain join forces with a new companion — a member of the Adeptus Arbites. As the past of House von Valancius begins to present itself in a new light, the Rogue Trader faces difficult decisions that may affect the future of the entire Koronus Expanse.<br/>
Over the course of this story, you will get a chance to learn more about the collection of the Imperial Tithe, otherwise known as the Grand Harvesting. Interfere with this fundamental process of the Imperium at your own peril. Discover new areas, game mechanics, and archetypes — and of course, encounter new horrors of the Immaterium.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion likewise offers 15 hours of gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Blood West</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/01_risk_of_rain_is_back.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Carefully designed, beautifully remastered, and loaded with new ways to play—Risk of Rain is back and better than ever! Dive into the iconic roguelike full of unique loot combinations, entirely new Survivors, overhauled multiplayer, and more!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/02_Before_and_after_revised.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/03_Uncover_New_Ways_to_Play_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Hone your skills and abilities, discover new Survivors, and dive into progressively stronger runs! Discover secrets of ancient design lying dormant beneath the surface of Petrichor V. Search under every log, stone, and Gup to find new ways to play!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/04_unlock_notification_popping_up.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/05_Header_Play_solo_or_gather_your_crew.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Many Survivors fled the mysterious attack on your ship. Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Game play introduction:<br/>
The game currently adopts Diablo-like gameplay and data. the concepts of anger system, general system, and attack distance have been emphasized. In order to enhance the game experience, the levels and values ​​required for some data have been modified.<br/>
The game is divided into three entrances: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell. Enemies that are immune to different types of damage will gradually appear at the entrance of Nightmare and Hell. Rainbow Jewelry and Halo (not yet online) can break the immunity. In the following different entrances, you can get different amounts of gold coins, diamonds, experience, and general points.<br/>
Rage system:<br/>
1) There are 6 types of anger: normal attack, shield, fire, lightning, cold, poison.<br/>
2) Normal attacks and shields must bring anger, and other elemental damages are added according to the damage type of the player character.<br/>
3) There are several balls at the bottom left of the game. When attacking or being attacked, the anger value will increase.<br/>
4) When the anger value reaches a certain value, click to release, during which the anger will be consumed at a rate of 10% per second.<br/>
5) During the release of anger, the gain of anger will no longer be increased.<br/>
6) During the release of anger, the damage skills corresponding to anger will be improved, and the shield will receive global damage reduction, up to 100%, effective for all damage.<br/>
7) Different rage values ​​can trigger different skill types, and each type has 4 attack skills.<br/>
General system:<br/>
1) The protagonist can choose between male and female, and can carry up to 5 generals.<br/>
2) Both generals and protagonists can be fully equipped with the same equipment.<br/>
3) The consumption of equipment durability is the same for the protagonist and generals.<br/>
4) Both the protagonist and generals have normal attack and skill attack, and each general has its own skill attack damage type.<br/>
5) The unlocking of generals needs to meet the points requirements, and the points can be obtained by killing the boss corresponding to the character.<br/>
6) The points given by the boss are different in different difficulties: 1 point for normal, 2 points for nightmares, 5 points for hell, doubled in death mode.<br/>
Attack distance:<br/>
1) Since the current game form is a battle formation, players cannot control the movement of characters in the battlefield.<br/>
2) The attack distance is calculated according to the front and rear distance positions of the battle formation, and the distance will be reduced by 1 every time a row of enemies is found forward.<br/>
3) Added the concept of adding 1 horse and subtracting 1 horse: -1 horse, the effect is -1 when you calculate the distance from others; +1 horse, the effect is +1 when others calculate the distance from you. There is a value of 2 at most, which enhances the offensive and defensive positions.<br/>
Pet system:<br/>
1) Pets provide attribute bonuses such as blood recovery and mana recovery for all teams in the battle formation through the aura.<br/>
2) Pets can only be equipped on the protagonist. If the protagonist is killed, the pet aura will be invalid.<br/>
Death Mode:<br/>
1) All reward attributes (gold coins, diamonds, experience, military commander points, acquisition of magic equipment, etc.) are doubled.<br/>
2) However, in this mode, the generals killed by the player will die and can no longer participate in the game, and the equipment on the dead character will also be lost.<br/>
3) Players can forcibly dismiss the game to avoid death, but only if all equipment or props in the backpack are lost.<br/>
4) Players cannot leave the battle in the combat state, and cannot advance or leave the game. Can only be forced to disband or forward teleportation.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							It is raining and pouring. It's not your average thunderstorm, but a primordial one. This storm doesn't seem to stop. At the same time, the storm is also producing gospel chanting, leading to people being attracted to the concert. The Land of Illusions ends up becoming empty, giving the local bands no opportunity to perform for their people.<br/><br/>Based on an original screenplay by Emiko Hosokawa, you take control of one of four humanoids to set out and find the source of the concert. Originally based on a fangame album featuring an original score by <i>Chuhou Joutai</i> creator Susumu Takajima, you must traverse six stages of varying terrain to find the concert's mastermind. Whether you're alone or with a friend*, your own danmaku is imperative. This will not be an easy journey - you must dodge your enemies' danmaku and overcome their spell cards.<br/><br/>*Additional accessories may be required for local multiplayer modes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Four playable characters spanning different backgrounds<br/></li><li>Four difficulty modes with different spell cards<br/></li><li>A six-stage main game plus a post-game extra stage<br/></li><li>A series of original characters created by Susumu Takajima and Emiko Hosokawa to fight against<br/></li><li>1990s-style musical score by Susumu Takajima<br/></li><li>Controller support<br/></li><li>Co-op mode</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The 5th entry in Liarsoft's Steampunk Series is a mysterious fairytale in which fantasy and reality intertwine.<br/><i>*This is the PC port of the Xbox360/PSP Refrain release upscaled to 1280 x 720.</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2><br/>The year is 1907. The 20th century is still young.<br/><br/>This is a world that experienced a 19th century very different from our own. A world of innumerable steam-powered Engines. The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they'd once known.<br/><br/>There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the "Great Disappearance" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets.<br/><br/>But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to her...<br/><br/>There is a place said to be the city's "Underground." This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted.<br/><br/>"Underground New York" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural "sky," the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist...<br/>	Cowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the "Messengers."<br/>	Suffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the "Messengers."<br/>They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something.<br/><br/>A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she's certain of.She doesn't have a reason. She doesn't know who or what awaits her. She doesn't even know why she feels this way. But even so, she's absolutely certain.<br/><br/>	"Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky."<br/>	"I have to go there. I'm the only one who can."<br/><br/>─The girl sets off for the tower of violet shadow looming far in the distance.<br/>─With every step, she finds the shades of those yet to fade away.<br/>─And sheds tears without knowing why.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2>- Visual Novel with a mix of fantasy and the historical real world.<br/><br/>- Vividely drawn CGs to explore!<br/>- 25 hours of average reading time.<br/>- Developed by Liar-soft, acclaimed for their Steampunk series!<br/>- Written and directed by Hikaru Sakurai						</div></div>]]></description>
