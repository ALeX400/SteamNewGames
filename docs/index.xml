<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE01_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG1.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG2.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE02_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG3.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE03_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG4.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE04_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE05_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG5.gif?t=1709230146"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera. Each photograph you take will translate the name of the content into Japanese and English so you can learn with your surroundings.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Take_Photo.gif?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A stylised, approachable 3D environment<br/></li><li>In-game photography system<br/></li><li>Japanese audio<br/></li><li>Photo album to store your flash cards<br/></li><li>A game mode that tests your memory<br/></li><li>Beginner phrases and grammar lessons<br/></li><li>Day/Night and weather cycle<br/></li><li>Display romaji, kana, furigana <i>(recommended)</i> or kanji</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Flash_Cards.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Create Stunning Photography Based Flashcards</h2>Every photo flash-card you take will be unique to you. The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Photo_Album.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Track Your Progress in the Photo Album</h2>Your photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							All City King is a stealth game where the player takes the role of an up-and-coming street<br>
artist. Your target is the subway trains and your goal is to make your art travel all over the<br>
city.<br>
Some games allow you to heist a bank where you take out the guards and escape with a<br>
giant pay-check. But in All City King, your “bank” is the trains, and your “pay-check” is your<br>
art or whatever message you feel fit to share. Enter the subway quietly, make your mark on<br>
the trains, and get out.<br/>
As you start your career as a street artist and after you have learned the ropes, your goal is<br/>
to spray paint subway cars in increasingly difficult missions. Sneak past patrolling security<br/>
guards, leave your mark on subway trains, and watch as your masterpiece leaves the<br/>
station!<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1845700/extras/top-banner.jpg?t=1709240419"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Collar welcomes you.</h2>Each of you have been hand picked from your normal life to participate in the experiment. You should be very honored The Collar has chosen you.<br/><br/>You have all been fitted with an identical collar. Each collar has a timer. Each of you have random times set on your timer. Once the trial begins, each collar will start to countdown to zero.<br/><br/>The collar lights glow indicating how much time you have left. The collar glowing green means it has the most time. The collar glowing red means it has the least time. The collars glowing yellow are in-between.<br/><br/>If your collar reaches zero, you will die.<br/><br/>If you die before your collar reaches zero, the closest person to you will receive your remaining time.<br/><br/>If you give up, The Collar will kill you.<br/><br/><strong>Only one will survive.<br/>Kill or be killed. Your choice.<br/>The Collar doesn't care.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">A Different Experience</h2>The Collar is a physics based first person game that pits you against strangers in a realistic way. This is <strong>not</strong> your typical "fighting" or "first person" game. You are not a ninja, or have magic, or some mythical creature with special powers. You are a regular human being. You fight like a regular human being. You can be hurt like a regular human being. There are things that are difficult as they would be in the real world. Choose to fight or be stealthy or come up with a different gameplay strategy all on your own. This game is a simulation of an experience.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1845700/extras/abilities-banner.jpg?t=1709240419"><h2 class="bb_tag">Abilities</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Crouch/Walk/Run<br/></li><li>Climb/Slide<br/></li><li>Swim/Dive<br/></li><li>Fight</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1845700/extras/weapons2-banner.jpg?t=1709240419"><h2 class="bb_tag">Environmental Weapons</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The Dowel: A rounded rod of wood to whack those who dare.<br/></li><li>The Rock: A hard broken piece of earth ready to smash anyone.<br/></li><li>The Stick: A stick given by the trees to whip whoever comes near you.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1845700/extras/weapons-banner.jpg?t=1709240419"><h2 class="bb_tag">Weapons</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The Axe: A sharpened steel blade affixed a strong wooden handle that will cut down anyone in its path.<br/></li><li>The Baseball Bat: A deadly hard piece of spun wood that will crack the head of even the strongest.<br/></li><li>The Crowbar: A curved, hardened, piece of steel, although small, can break a bone or a back in a single swing.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1845700/extras/environment-banner.jpg?t=1709240419"><h2 class="bb_tag">Environment</h2>From hot and cold to falling and drowning, the environment can cause some big problems. Even death.<br/><br/>Cold climates will cause Hypothermia.<br/>Hot climates can cause Heatstroke.<br/><br/>And do not even try to escape during the experiment. The Collar knows.<h2 class="bb_tag">MESSAGE FROM THE DEV</h2>The Collar is being designed in order to provide a different online multiplayer experience. From sound, realism, emersion, and minimalistic design, my game development process is designed to allow the player to enter worlds like they were a part of a movie you would normally watch, but now get to be the main character.<br/><br/>The Collar has been in development for over two years. I am very proud of The Collar in its current state. I want to keep adding meaningful content for another 1-2 years whilst still living up to the goal of a realistic experience. I am fully prepared for it to take even longer, if it means a better and a more well-rounded experience in the end. The game is not perfect and I understand that, which is why I have a roadmap of things I want to improve and iterate on to make this game experience better over time. The community has always helped shape and mold the game as it stands today and will definitely continue to do so as the community grows.<br/><br/>This passion game of mine does not end at Steam release, but is only the beginning. I am sure we will have plenty more interactions and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes us together. I enjoy playing my own game especially with friends and soon with new friends I am sure I will meet along the way. If you see me in a match, jump in and say hi! It is fun to hear additional impressions of the game and play style. Until then, The Collar is waiting.<h2 class="bb_tag">WARNING</h2>The Collar contains flashing lights, patterns, and images which may not be suitable for photosensitive epilepsy. If you experience any of the following symptoms while playing The Collar, dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming playing The Collar.<br/><br/>The Collar contains scenes of realistic graphic violence and gore and may be disturbing to some. Under no circumstances should you attempt to do any of the things that happen in this game in real life. If you are easily offended or have a hard time separating fantasy from reality, this game is probably not for you.						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pincrediball is a fun twist on the pinball game genre. <i>You</i> design the Pinball machine, and the Automata Pinball Wizard follows a "Playbook" to play your design. Achieve High Scores and earn medals to advance levels.<h2 class="bb_tag">How to play</h2><br/>Think of a "Machine" as a "World" with stages (or "levels"). At each level you unlock new components to add to the Pinball machine. Place these components in the right spots on the machine, and hit "Run Playbook" to see what score it gets you.<br/><br/>With some tiny spoilers, here's one way to handle the Tutorial Machine's final stage:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2378150/extras/steam-description-bb-image-animated-shrunk.gif?t=1709237278"><br/><br/>Every playbook <i>must</i> end by draining the ball (at the bottom of the machine) within the given time limit. If you succeed, your score will count and gets you a bronze, silver, or even gold medal if you cross a certain target. At least bronze is needed to advance a level.<br/><br/>Going for silver and gold after bronze? Or advance to the next level? It's your choice! And you could also go back to go full completionist on a level!!<h2 class="bb_tag">What is included?</h2><br/>Pincrediball has many features, including (but not limited to):<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> A Tutorial Machine (a "world") with several levels to play.<br/></li><li> Target scores (bronze, silver, gold) and a progression system, based on high scores.<br/></li><li> A multi-multi-multi-ball "Stress Test" mode to test your setup, or just for fun!</li></ul><br/>The trailer showcases all these features as well as many others.<h2 class="bb_tag">About the Development</h2><br/>This game was created as a solo sabbatical project. You can read about the full development history on the website's devlog, and even view the source code (written for the Godot 4 engine).						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Preface:<br/><br/>"Main Deity Space" is my first attempt at making a game in my life. Since I have zero programming knowledge and can't understand code, Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) with its Blueprint system provided me with the opportunity to try my hand at creating a game that I love. I am extremely grateful to UE5 engine for this.<br/><br/>During the development process, I conducted testing by releasing a game full of bugs on the Steam platform. I received a lot of help from player friends who patiently tested the game and provided suggestions. I am truly, truly thankful for their support.<br/><br/>The version currently online is still very basic, with professions, skills, equipment, materials, enemies, and maps continuously being added. The game itself definitely has many issues, and I hope everyone can understand and provide feedback so that I can make continuous improvements and adjustments.<br/><br/>After the official version is released, the testing version will not be canceled and will continue to be updated. However, the official version will be given priority for updates, with the testing version being updated once a month. <br/><br/>Apart from the difference in update timing, the leaderboards between the two versions will not be connected, and the testing version will not participate in future reward activities. However, there will be no difference in gameplay and content between the two versions.<br/><br/>For those who are willing to support me, you can purchase the official version, and I am sincerely grateful for your support.<br/><br/>Below is the introduction to the game itself:<br/><br/>"Main Deity Space" is a small game inspired by games like "Vampire Survivors" and "Diablo".<br/>The main theme is killing monsters, farming equipment, leveling up, drawing cards, farming materials, crafting equipment, upgrading followers, collecting pets, and so on.<br/><br/>Accidentally traversing into the realm of the Main Deity, embark on an endless cycle of slaughter. Strengthen yourself and your companions continuously through the trials initiated by the Main Deity.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B1.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>Through trials, safely returning to the Main Deity's space allows you to initiate new trials and face new challenges. The rewards become more abundant with higher difficulties, but in the event of death, all gains will be lost. Upon a safe return, you can bring back the rewards obtained during the trials—currency, equipment, materials, and more. The Main Deity's space also facilitates the exchange of various items, including gems, equipment, enhancement materials, and even skill upgrades.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B2.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>You can also craft various needed materials, totems, and even followers through the Main Deity.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B3.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>At the same time, the Main Deity also provides a storage vault, allowing you to save items before embarking on an adventure. After all, if you cannot survive, you won't be able to bring back any items.<br/>With the rich experience gained in battles, you will level up and acquire attribute points that can be allocated to strengthen attributes such as strength, life, mana, speed, and more. You will also earn skill points to upgrade skills as needed.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B4.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>During the trial process, you can obtain or craft companions with different characteristics to assist you in battle. They are powerful and can also be upgraded with equipment and skills. They will engage in combat autonomously. Up to 5 different companions can coexist at the same time, providing the most powerful assistance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2650570/extras/B5.jpg?t=1709230904"><br/>Survive together with them!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE01_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen!

Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.  <br/>It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG2.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE02_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. <br/>Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! <br/>However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG3.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE03_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. <br/>It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. <br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG4.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE04_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/><br/>You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable.<br/>Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.<br/>ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/TITLE05_EN.gif?t=1709230146"><br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1519090/extras/Paradize_IMG5.gif?t=1709230146"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							After experiencing a devastating car crash in the middle of the desert, you awaken stranded at a long-abandoned gas station. A voice on the radio calls out to you, trapped nearby but just out of reach. Together you discover remnants of a missing cult, unholy rituals, a mysterious cavern, and bloodthirsty creatures hunting you both down. With the walls closing in, can you follow in the cultist's footsteps and complete their final ritual -- <i>before it's too late?</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Lose Your Mind</h2>Witnessing horrors will chip away at your psyche, depicted by your Nerve meter. As you slowly lose touch with reality, audiovisual hallucinations and other unforeseen consequences will begin to manifest. The effects of a weakened mind are wide-ranging and completely unscripted - meaning any manner of horrors can happen at any time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fight</h2>Face threats head-on with a wide variety of guns and melee weapons. From hammers, to nailguns, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, and much more. All weapons are able to be upgraded to fit your needs.<h2 class="bb_tag">Scavenge</h2>Discover valuable supplies hidden away in every corner of the world. Use them at-will, or break them down in to raw materials to be used in arcane transmutation. Collect recipes to unlock the ability to transmute these materials into completely new items.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hide</h2>Avoid dangers by keeping a low profile. Create distractions by making noise, or take to the shadows to remain unseen. Flip switches or shoot out lights to gain the element of surprise, or power them all on to see what's lurking in the darkness.<h2 class="bb_tag">Run</h2>Escape your pursuers with a mixture of both agility and ingenuity. Vault over barricades, slide under obstacles, and climb anything to put distance between you and imminent death.<h2 class="bb_tag">Improvise</h2>No key for that door? Find a hole in the wall. Break a window. Crawl through a hatch. Climb up a pipe. Every encounter is designed with numerous solutions in mind, further multiplied by emergent systems allowing for completely new ways to tackle problems.						</div></div>]]></description>
