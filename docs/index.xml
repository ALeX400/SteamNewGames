<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/01_risk_of_rain_is_back.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Carefully designed, beautifully remastered, and loaded with new ways to play—Risk of Rain is back and better than ever!

Discover secrets of ancient design lying dormant beneath the surface of Petrichor V.

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Planet S is a real-time strategy game where your goal is to colonize multiple planets in a solar system to advance your civilization, build a city and supply it to grow your faction.<h2 class="bb_tag">Procedural planets</h2>The world consists of up to 14 procedurally generated planets which you can colonize. A planets type affects things like the appearance, the farm productivity and the kind of resources you can find on it. Every player starts the game with a spaceship and enough materials to colonize their first planet. Uncolonized planets can be claimed by building a spaceport on it. Once you claimed a planet, you can integrate it into your economy! <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/PP.gif?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Build your civilization</h2>To advance your faction and unlock new buildings you need to attract residents and provide them the goods they require. By gaining more and more residents, you will unlock new production chains which will increase in complexity. At some point, your first planet won't be able to supply you with the resources you need, so you need to expand to other planets. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/Build_Your_Civ.gif?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Choose your path</h2>While you start your population with workers, you need to make a decision when you advance to the second tier. You can upgrade your residents to the science or military civilization type. You can adjust the direction in an adjacent city center. Your decision will determine your path for the game and set a focus on either a more peacefully or a violent way of playing and winning the game. It may be rational to carefully consider your decision and adapt to the situation you are in. <br/><br/>Residents of a civilization type generate either science or military research points, which you can invest into research. The two research trees unlock bonuses and unique buildings for the corresponding civilization type. Through that, the game experience will rely heavily on the path you select. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/Choose_your_path.png?t=1700519036"><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer</h2><br/>You can play alone or with up to three friends. You can either practice diplomacy and negotiate agreements, or act militarily against each other. Coupled with the fact that each player can build his civilization differently, every game remains exciting. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1948430/extras/War.png?t=1700519036"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>A <i>free</i> game by the co-creator of the XBox's Fable series.</strong><br/><br/>Five hundred years ago, the land of Caldera was plunged into endless darkness. Decades later, five moons rose in the sky, bringing light to the world and strange Gods with it. With them came the Dreams: calls to Devotion promising supernatural Gifts.<br/><br/>Thus, the new Calderan civilisation was born; a world of Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts, with a Dreamless Archon acting as the Gods' mortal representative. But Archons are not eternal, and a successor must be found.<br/><br/>You are Dreamless: free to choose your own destiny, to ask questions others dare not, or even become Archon yourself.<br/><br/>What will you do, Dreamless one?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>Moonring is a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games, but created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities.<br/><br/>The world's geography is hand-designed, but the deadly dungeons beneath the surface reconfigure each time you leave... or die.<br/><br/>Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera. Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>Features:<br/>- Large, hand-designed open world<br/>- An infinite supply of dungeons generated using your character name<br/>- Over 100 varied enemy types, from fodder to bosses<br/>- 35 unique Gifts from the Gods, their usage changing with the moon phases<br/>- Sailing, ship-to-ship combat and boarding<br/>- A Dungeon Synth OST with over 50 tracks, all made using retro Mod Trackers!<br/>- A hidden magic system and many other mysteries<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373630/extras/SteamSeparator.png?t=1697860475"><br/>A note from the creator:<br/><br/>Hi folks. I've loved RPGs since the early 1980s, and grew up playing games like Lord British's 'Ultima' series and early Roguelikes. This is my love-letter to a style of gaming that has largely fallen out of fashion: with its vivid, bright sprites overlaid on stark black backgrounds, true open-world gameplay, and lack of handholding. The days I spent playing these games were spent in joyful exploration and discovery, venturing into the dark unknown, a co-author of the experience, filling in the gaps left by the primitive art with my imagination. For those of you who did the same, I hope Moonring recaptures some of the spirit of those days for you. For those who did not, I hope that the more modern conveniences you find in this game allow you to catch a glimpse of what we did 40 years ago.<br/><br/>My heartfelt thanks to all who spared even a moment to play this. Please be kind to my mistakes. I will fix them. :-)<br/><br/>- Dene						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Click and drag to place asteroids, planets, and stars, then send them flying into the matching targets in a physics-based puzzle game where everything attracts everything. The levels start simple, but ramp up to include several moving parts and tricky solutions. You'll need to plan your placements carefully in order to win!<h2 class="bb_tag">Featuring:</h2>80 hand-crafted levels to master<br/><br/><br/>An N-body gravity system where everything can move if something near it is heavy enough, or if something crashes into it. These puzzles are firmly grounded in real orbital mechanics!<br/>(Aside from the targets. They don't move.)<h2 class="bb_tag">Unique types of matter for unique puzzles:</h2>Antimatter: Crash a normal object into it to launch it away and shave off some mass. Or avoid doing that if you need to keep something onscreen.<br/><br/><br/>Exotic matter: It has negative mass, which means it pushes things away instead of attracting them. It's still attracted to normal matter, though.						</div></div>]]></description>
