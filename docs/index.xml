<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, what do you mean we’re moving?!</h2>Just great; just when Inco was getting ready to move on into his Senior year, his parents decide to uproot his life and move half-way across the country!<br/><br/>Guess it’s time to start all over. Sure, Inco didn’t have many friends (or any) back at his old school, and sure, he was so low on the social ladder that he had to get a deep-sea diving lesson…. Wait, why was he complaining about moving again?<br/><br/>I Wani Hug that Gator is a multi-ended, choices-matter visual novel about second chances and the power of accepting who you are. Shape how Inco makes the most of his final year, and how the relationships he makes along the way will develop. One relationship in particular has him feeling all fuzzy inside…<h2 class="bb_tag">The Prehistoric Romance a Million-and-One Years in the making!</h2>If there’s one good thing to come out of Inco’s sudden relocation, it’s Olivia. Bold and brash, Olivia seems particularly gifted in getting under Inco’s skin. No matter how Inco slices it, he and Olivia seem destined to go together like a particularly scaly sandwich. But the outcome of such a pairing is yet to be determined…<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, am I being graded on this?!</h2>Make friends, reconcile enemies, and figure out how Inco could possibly repair his miserable excuse for a social life.  But be warned: The choices you make expands the relationships with Inco’s classmates and determines which of the four unique endings you receive. Maybe Inco should’ve spent a little less time studying and a bit more time learning how to relate to people…						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of one of the three adventurers: youthful French aristocrat, a formidable Spanish mercenary, or a savvy English entrepreneur. Explore, trade, plunder, complete quests and enjoy the Caribbean Open World. This game has the most of improvements and a good portion of new content from the upcoming Caribbean Legend. <strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/steamchar2.jpg?t=1707850966"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имени-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The Caribbean is your domain, offering everything from exploring ancient pyramids to capturing entire towns.<br/></li><li><strong>Hundred Recurring Quests</strong>: Engage in a myriad of quests, each with multiple potential outcomes, including freight jobs, bounty hunting, trading contracts, and more!<br/></li><li><strong>Unique Quests:</strong> Embark on twenty distinctive quests, each with its own compelling narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Land and Naval Warfare</strong>: Transition from confronting thugs in jungles and pirating a small game to leading full-scale sieges and commanding an armada of warships.<br/></li><li><strong>Extensive Customisation</strong>: Tailor your experience with character builds, dozens of ships, and a vast array of over a hundred items and weapons.<br/></li><li><strong>Side Activities</strong>: Immerse yourself in a wide range of activities, including crafting, trading, duels, gambling, smuggling, romance, ship upgrading, and treasure hunting.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имениdd-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/>Caribbean Legend: Sandbox is at the beginning of its journey as we aim to create the ultimate pirate freeplay game. This game is still under development, and while we haven't finalized all the main future milestones, our general vision is already taking shape. The old Sea Dogs approach primarily focused on expanding quest content. When a player completed all available side quests, their journey in the game would come to an end. This approach wasn't necessarily flawed, but we're excited to explore a new direction. <br/><br/>What if the game consistently generated one-of-a-kind situations for players, ensuring each playthrough remains captivating and distinctive, from the early game to the very end? Let's discover the possibilities! Based on sales of the full game and community feedback, the following roadmap may undergo adjustments, to the lesser or (hopefully!) the bigger scale. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/en-roadmap.png?t=1707850966"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, what do you mean we’re moving?!</h2>Just great; just when Inco was getting ready to move on into his Senior year, his parents decide to uproot his life and move half-way across the country!<br/><br/>Guess it’s time to start all over. Sure, Inco didn’t have many friends (or any) back at his old school, and sure, he was so low on the social ladder that he had to get a deep-sea diving lesson…. Wait, why was he complaining about moving again?<br/><br/>I Wani Hug that Gator is a multi-ended, choices-matter visual novel about second chances and the power of accepting who you are. Shape how Inco makes the most of his final year, and how the relationships he makes along the way will develop. One relationship in particular has him feeling all fuzzy inside…<h2 class="bb_tag">The Prehistoric Romance a Million-and-One Years in the making!</h2>If there’s one good thing to come out of Inco’s sudden relocation, it’s Olivia. Bold and brash, Olivia seems particularly gifted in getting under Inco’s skin. No matter how Inco slices it, he and Olivia seem destined to go together like a particularly scaly sandwich. But the outcome of such a pairing is yet to be determined…<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, am I being graded on this?!</h2>Make friends, reconcile enemies, and figure out how Inco could possibly repair his miserable excuse for a social life.  But be warned: The choices you make expands the relationships with Inco’s classmates and determines which of the four unique endings you receive. Maybe Inco should’ve spent a little less time studying and a bit more time learning how to relate to people…						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">what Is Folgore </h2>Folgore is a top view fighting game, inspired by comics, taking place in south Italy at the end of the 60’s. <br/><br/>To save his fiancée and his honor, the hero must cross the city of Olimpia, inspired by Naples, and eliminate all types of enemies on his way to the final boss. To do that, he makes a pact with the Folgore, a divine artifact endowed with electrical powers from Jupiter, but renowned to be dangerous for its owner .<br/><br/>With the Folgore, the player can attack by combining melee attacks and electrical powers. He can also interact with his environment to stun his enemies and continue the level.<br/>During some scenarized moments, an ultimate power called the overload activates to remind the instability of the Folgore and make the player experience even more pleasurable.<br/><br/><br/>The goal in Folgore is to let off steam while playing an original game full of dark humor. The player needs to feel the strength of his powers, but also the shift of the “hero” to the dark side.<br/><br/>To treat this subject correctly, we took a lot of inspiration from dark comics like Batman, we decided to combine 2D and 3D to accentuate this.<br/>To understand the genesis of Folgore, look at a comic book. But instead of reading it, you are going to play it.<br/><br/><br/>In Folgore, we wanted a strong identity : the temporality of the game is unique, blending the Italian 50’s and Roman mythology, which allowed us a lot of liberty, especially for the creation of enemies. The dark comics aesthetic and humor of the game remind the player of the anti-hero personality of the playable character, but also the grim after-war period in Italy. For the gameplay, we came back to the basics : not a lot of inputs and a gameplay easy to learn that needs to be mastered to be effective. The originality resides in the electrical powers that Giove got from the Folgore : It allows him to interact with his environment and perform faster and more powerful attacks and movements, while getting the player to manage his power gauge to survive the enemies' waves. Finally, even if it's better to play the game with a controller, we chose to adapt the game for arcades to remember the feeling of an old school beat them all.<h2 class="bb_tag">Team: </h2><br/>Hugo Angel : Sound Designer (Audio Workshop)<br/>Sasha Bassanetti : Sound Designer (Audio Workshop)<br/>Léo Beauchamp : Lead Scenario / 2D Artist (ETPA)<br/>Khenan Benanou : Lead Programmer / AI Programmer / Lead Level Design (ETPA)<br/>Eve Cabanié : Lead Producer / Lead Artistic Direction / 3D Character Artist (ETPA)<br/>Sami Delvallée : Lead 3D Artist / Environment Artist / Lead Sound Design (ETPA)<br/>Mathis Dinger : Lead VFX / Programmer (ETPA)<br/>Thomas Exshaw : 3D Props Artist (ETPA)<br/>Maxime Maridet : Lead Animator / Rigger (ETPA)<br/>Edouard Mordant : Gameplay Programmer / Lead Game Designer (ETPA)<br/>Anaïs Tigneres Agout : Lead 2D Artist / UI-UX Designer / 3D Props Artist (ETPA)						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">About the Game</h2><br/>We think the best way for us to explain this game is to tell you how we came up with this idea. Everybody who works at Repulse loves fantasy anime. We are huge fans of shows like Attack on Titan and Full Metal Alchemist.  And we also like to play visual novels, especially the ones with erotic and lesbian content.<br/><br/>When we finished our last game, we asked ourselves:  What if we could combine the elements we love most about anime and visual novels in an interactive VR experience that you could also play without VR. And that is exactly what Iragon is about.<br/><br/>You play the game as Darick, a poor kid from a small village.  Everything for him changes when he meets a bisexual girl who gets ambushed by soldiers of the Empire. To help her, you must learn to use your magic, but on your quest to bring her home safe, you will have to journey into a dangerous frozen world.  Along the way, you will battle enemy soldiers, undead skeletons, and perhaps cross paths with seductive creatures of the frozen land while you unlock new erotic adventures with her.<br/><br/>So this is ultimately a game about living out a high fantasy adventure, with a strong emphasis on putting the player in control.  The game is meant to be experienced in VR, but we dedicated an equal amount of care to deliver a standard version that will work for players who do not have a VR headset.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2>Whether you play in VR or not, you can expect us to deliver:<br/><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 3 Main storyline romance routes<br/></li><li> 4 Side romance routes<br/></li><li> 12 Monster girls you can romance<br/></li><li> Interactive experiences with your love interests<br/></li><li> Different outfits<br/></li><li> Voice acting<br/></li><li> Motion captured animations<br/></li><li> A dynamic combat system that features both magic and melee;<br/></li><li> Destructible environments;<br/></li><li> A dialogue choice system that influences the response you get.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2>Be the hero, live the story, and go on an adventure of a lifetime while you immerse yourself fully in the world of Iragon, with a complete animated story and full voice acted cast.  (skip options are also available for those who prefer to just get on with the action.)<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2>And yes, of course, this is not just a story you watch it is a game. Battle enemies, cast spells, collect loot, upgrade, interact with NPC's, go on quests. It has everything you would expect from a fantasy RPG game.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a survival escape action game from a huge wave that will make you feel fear and despair within the first minute.<br>
<br>
The setting is an exoplanet where waves of over 3,000 feet (about 900 meters) are constantly hitting the surface of the planet, due to the gravity of a giant red dwarf star and its orbital period of about 60 minutes.<br>
The objective of the player is to escape from the waves and survive.<br>
<br>
This game is an escape game, but there are no complicated puzzle elements; all you need is the courage and strength to overcome fear.<br>
<br/>
Overcoming this fear, thinking and acting in order to survive, continuing to challenge without giving up, and the scenery you see after surviving will surely leave a strong impression on the minds of those who play the game.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
