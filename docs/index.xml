<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Schmaragon is an exciting third-person indie MOBA with shared experience, created using assets from Paragon.<h2 class="bb_tag">Schmaragon also boasts a set of interesting features:</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Variable-powered heroes</strong>: Some heroes are significantly more powerful than others. For example, Level 3 heroes are 4-5 times more powerful than Level 1 heroes.</li><li><strong>Hero companions</strong>: A mutt or a beast that you can control, providing you with combat and tactical advantages.</li><li>Schmaragon players can choose which abilities they want their heroes to have, and they can even change their heroes after the match has already started.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The team-based leveling system and its consequences:</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Schmaragon employs a team-based leveling system, where all team members share the same XP level and acquire abilities and items simultaneously.<br/></li><li>Because all team members always maintain the same XP level, players can leave the match at any time, knowing that they will be promptly replaced by another player of the same XP level.<br/></li><li>Therefore, we've introduced some interesting measures. A 1-minute AFK (Away From Keyboard) period will result in removal from the match, while 2 minutes of no contribution (e.g., no damage dealt to enemies) will lead to a ban from the match.<br/></li><li>Team members can also vote to ban other team members from the match (requiring 4 out of 6 votes).<br/></li><li>Because heroes have varying power levels (three Level 1, two Level 2, and one Level 3 hero on each team), they don't equally impact the match's outcome. Level 3 heroes have the most significant impact. The idea is that less experienced players would opt for Level 1 heroes, which have a lesser impact on the match's outcome.<br/></li><li>Players have an incentive to stay until the end of the match due to the permadeath mechanic, as they receive bonus hero lives for doing so.<br/></li><li>Additionally, there's a concept of adjusting bounties. Dying frequently reduces the XP fed to the opposing team, while accumulating many kills increases your bounty.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Permadeath mechanic explained:</h2><br/>In this unique MOBA setup, heroes start with a limited number of lives. They lose lives when defeated but can regain them by vanquishing creeps, defeating enemy heroes, or participating in the game until the end of the match. <strong>This is important: lives are permanently stored on a central server, guaranteeing that the number of lives persists and carries over between matches.</strong> If a hero runs out of lives, the player can no longer play as that hero.<br/><br/><strong>The gameplay and psychological impacts of permadeath:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Dying only affects you; the impact of death on your team is minor. That means less toxicity between teammates and a friendlier environment for new players.<br/></li><li>Although not a requirement, there is a strong incentive for every player to finish the match because big rewards in terms of hero lives are granted at the end.<br/></li><li>The concept draws inspiration from Eve Online, where players command spaceships susceptible to destruction in diverse ways. Once your ship is destroyed, it is permanently lost. While you can acquire another, the one you originally had is irretrievably gone.<br/></li><li>Permadeath can add a heightened sense of risk and reward to the gaming experience. Knowing that failure carries consequences can make success more satisfying.<br/></li><li>Permadeath can lead to stronger emotional connections between players and their characters or assets. The fear of loss can make victories more meaningful.<br/></li><li>The potential for permanent consequences encourages players to learn from their mistakes, adapt their strategies, and become more skilled over time.</li></ul><br/><strong>Questions and answers:</strong><br/><br/><i><strong>Q:</strong> Is the only effect of permadeath going to be that people play much more defensively and care less about their teammates?</i><br/><strong>A:</strong> This is a valid point, but we have some countermechanics:<br/>If the hero life loss becomes too overwhelming, players have the option to fall back to a default hero (Kwang, Serath, or Crunch), which is not affected by the permadeath system. This is because Schmaragon allows changing the hero in the middle of the match. If the hero life loss is still too overwhelming, players have the option to leave the match. This is because, as explained earlier, Schmaragon doesn't penalize quitting in the middle of the match.<br/><br/><i><strong>Q:</strong> Encouraging quitting during the match? That doesn't seem like the best idea.</i><br/><strong>A:</strong> There is a strong incentive for every player to finish the match because big rewards in terms of hero lives are granted at the end. However, if you have to leave for any reason, we will not penalize you. <br/><br/><i><strong>Q:</strong> Doesn't it sound like a system that only exists to charge players money when they run out of lives?</i><br/><strong>A:</strong> We promise not to use any shady methods to make money. Currently, our studio doesn't have a monetization plan.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A rescue team is called out to investigate a distress signal coming from a ship identified as the MTS Endurance - a ship known to have disappeared 4 years ago on a voyage across the Atlantic. The rescue operation goes awry, and you are left stranded and alone on the derelict ship. Searching below deck you find no sign of life. The crew appears to have just vanished; replaced with eerie stone statues, but perhaps you're not as alone as you first thought. Explore the derelict ship to uncover what happened 4 years ago and what fate befell the crew.<br>
<br>

You play as a lone member of a rescue crew who must complete puzzles and explore the derelict ship while trying to avoid meeting the same fate as the missing crew. Danger lurks around every corner - you must run or hide to stay alive as you learn more about the ship and what caused its mysterious disappearance 4 years ago.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Embark on an electrifying odyssey through ancient world in "Samurai`s Way", the inaugural title from TinC Studio that merges the relentless thrill of a 2D runner with the strategic depth of a clicker arcade. Drawing inspiration from the storied philosophy of the samurai way, this game invites players to step into the sandals of a novice warrior, forged in the spirit of Bushido, on an epic quest for honor and enlightenment.<br>
<br>
As the dawn mist settles over the emerald hills of ancient world, our hero, a young samurai named Kenji, finds himself on a path filled with perils and revelations. Disillusioned by the tyranny corrupting his homeland, Kenji embarks on a relentless journey, seeking wisdom and the strength to bring peace to his people. His travels are not just a test of skill but a spiritual trial to uphold the virtues of Rectitude, Courage, Benevolence, Respect, Honesty, Honor, and Loyalty, which are the pillars of his warrior soul.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>
