<h2>About This Content</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Main_Banner.gif?t=1710259123"><br/><br/>Dead by Daylight’s All Things Wicked delves into the depths of analog horror with <strong>new Killer, The Unknown</strong>, and <strong>new Survivor, Sable Ward</strong>. A new Map, <strong>Greenville Square</strong>, is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on unlocks 2 exclusive Cosmetics: <strong>The Unknown’s Garden Casual</strong> and <strong>Sable Ward’s Designer Corset</strong>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Killer_Power.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">THE UNKNOWN</h2>If you hear a soft voice crying out for help in the woods, stay the hell away. The true nature of The Unknown remains a mystery, barring one fatal certainty: to cross its path is to risk an unknowable fate.<br/><br/><strong>The Unknown’s Power: UVX (Unknown Venom X)</strong><br/><br/>Charge and launch a burst of UVX, which bounces once and creates a Blast Area upon impact. If they touch the Blast Area, they will become Weakened against your Power.   <br/>If a Survivor is Weakened, they will lose a Health State whenever they touch a Blast Area. Survivors can lose the Weakened status by successfully looking at The Unknown for a brief duration.<br/><br/><strong>Special Ability: Hallucinations</strong><br/><br/>During a Trial, The Unknown will intermittently create Hallucinations and leave them in its wake. The Unknown can highlight and teleport to any Hallucination, leaving behind a temporary Decoy version of itself. Survivors can Dispel Hallucinations, but only by staring at one while standing completely still. Weakened Survivors will take longer to Dispel a Hallucination, and any incomplete attempt will reveal their location through Killer Instinct. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Killer_Perks.jpg?t=1710259123"><br/><br/>The Unknown comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Unbound</h2>Unbound activates for a duration when a Survivor becomes injured. During this time, you’ll gain a brief speed boost whenever you Vault a Window.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unforeseen</h2>When you kick a Generator, your Terror Radius transfers to it for a duration. During this time, your Terror Radius increases and you become Undetectable.<h2 class="bb_tag">Undone</h2>Gain Tokens whenever a Survivor misses a Skill Check. When you damage a Generator, all Tokens will be consumed. For each Token consumed, the Generator loses 1% total progress and becomes blocked for 1 second.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Survivor_Perks.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">SABLE WARD</h2>While some fear the darkness, Sable Ward embraces it. Fascinated by horror and drawn to all things wicked, Sable was among the few Survivors to willingly step into The Fog in search of her best friend Mikaela.<br/>Sable Ward comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Invocation: Weaving Spiders</h2>This Invocation can only be performed in the Basement and takes a considerable duration of time to complete. Survivors can see your Aura during the process and can join you, increasing the Invocation’s speed.  <br/>Once complete, all Survivors will gain a boost of Repair progress. On the other hand, you’ll be Injured and Broken for the remainder of the Trial.<h2 class="bb_tag">Strength in Shadows</h2>When in the basement, you can quickly heal without a Med-Kit. Afterward, the Killer’s Aura is briefly revealed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Wicked</h2>Gain the ability to successfully unhook yourself from Basement Hooks. When you successfully do so, the Killer’s Aura is briefly revealed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_New_Map.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">NEW MAP: GREENVILLE SQUARE*</h2><br/>A slice of small-town Americana, long abandoned, long forgotten. Now, something wanders freely along the overgrown streets: a writhing creature responsible for a string of disappearances across the country.<br/>*This map is free for all players.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Exclusive_Item_Killer.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">EXCLUSIVE CHAPTER KILLER ITEM: GARDEN CASUAL</h2>Her prize-winning peonies wilted and died without someone to care for them.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/GreenDragon.gif?t=1709885067"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTER</strong></h2><br/><br/>Stolen Realm is a <strong>simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements</strong> where you control up to <strong>6 heroes, solo or through online co-op</strong>, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. <br/><br/>Stolen Realm features an <strong>innovative turn-based combat system</strong> where <strong>simultaneous turns</strong> allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!<br/> <br/>With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&amp;D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  <br/><br/>Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> – or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!<br/><br/>Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!<br/><br/>Carve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield. <strong>Recover the Stolen Realm.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/CycloneKick.gif?t=1709885067"><h2 class="bb_tag">PRAISE FOR STOLEN REALM</h2><br/>“The tactical depth of Divinity: Original Sin” - GamesRadar+<br/><br/>“we’re losing our evenings to… Stolen Realm” - TheXboxHub<br/><br/>“A gorgeous looking game” - PC Gamer<br/><br/>“You can be a fire warrior.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control.

You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away.

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Buka_2.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>A <strong>thaumaturge</strong> bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for <strong>Wiktor Szulski</strong>, the game’s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktor’s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as <strong>salutors</strong> - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Wiktor_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Shape your story</strong> – as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. <br/></li><li><strong>Develop your character</strong> – creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. <br/></li><li><strong>Experience unique turn-based combat</strong> and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.<br/></li><li><strong>Influence and manipulate</strong> the temperaments of other characters to bend their will to your liking. <br/></li><li><strong>Tame the power of salutors</strong> – use the unique set of their skills to gain an advantage while exploring the world and when bringing your adversaries to their knees. <br/></li><li><strong>See the world that’s inevitably gone</strong> – explore the uncommon, heavily researched historic period of the early XX century Warsaw, where crime and luxury are often two sides of the same coin. Meet historical figures and learn about their involvement in the story. <br/></li><li><strong>Created in Unreal Engine 5</strong> to deliver a detailed &amp; beautifully crafted world.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1710238670"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1710238670"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1710238670"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents.

Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
