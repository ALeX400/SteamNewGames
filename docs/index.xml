<h2>About This Content</h2>
							The <strong>EF-24G</strong> <i>"Mischief"</i> is a two-seat, twin-engine, variable-sweep fighter aircraft which has been adapted and equipped to play a major role in electronic warfare (EW). Specialized sensors and advanced multi-mode ECM pods give it the capability to find, target, and wreak havoc on all kinds of enemy transmissions. Smartly managing the various systems can be a complex task, so another player can enter the rear seat as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO).<h2 class="bb_tag">AN/ALQ-245 Multi-mode Electronic Countermeasure Pod</h2>This special piece of equipment is the pinnacle of ECM technology. It can transmit low, medium, and high frequencies in various modes:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Noise: Barrage the target with noise to reduce its ability to detect meaningful signals. Depending on the frequency, this can affect radar detection, GPS, communications, etc.<br/></li><li>DRFM: Digital Radio Frequency Memory is a technique where incoming radar signals are processed and returned to the sender to create false contacts and pull off locks.<br/></li><li>SAS: The Signal Augmentation System allows the pod to reshape its radar return in order to appear as a different kind of aircraft on the target's radar.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">ADM-160J Air-launched Decoy/Jammer</h2>This jet-powered missile can be deployed to fly orbits around target locations or follow a GPS path. It carries the same signature augmentation system, giving it the ability to appear like a fighter, bomber, or any other aircraft on radar. It can also operate in jamming mode to help suppress enemy air defenses. It maintains a datalink with your aircraft so it can be updated while in-flight with new routes or targets, and share its RWR contacts for triangulation and analysis.<h2 class="bb_tag">Sensor Fusion and Datalink</h2>The Mischief utilizes 5th generation tactical systems like the F-45, with additions and modifications to help it excel in EW. It automatically links up with teammates to triangulate radar positions, gather information on target frequencies and configurations, and provide you with all the information you need to carry on your mission.<h2 class="bb_tag">Variable Sweep Wings</h2>The EF-24's swing wings allow it to reach high top speeds while still being able to operate off an aircraft carrier. The ECM pods deploy ram air turbine intakes when necessary to feed power hungry operations, but the aircraft's aerodynamic configuration allows it to maintain supersonic flight even in the draggiest state.<h2 class="bb_tag">Sensor Displays</h2>Analyze the EM environment in the FRAZ (Frequency/Azimuth) display, and get a read on the general signals being detected in all directions on the TSD. Take full control of the radar while still being able to quickly and easily designate targets on the TSD.<h2 class="bb_tag">Weapons</h2>Take on radar targets with various types of anti-radiation missiles. Launch a heavy air-to-air payload at long ranges with the AIM-54. Carry high capacity racks of unguided and precision bombs between the engines.						</div></div>]]></description>

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>“All is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come”, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape’s audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. “Time ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles… but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh—don’t come too close, you don’t want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?” The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. “Ah, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see… something… several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots – what could all this mean?”<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1703077208"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that <strong>your Dungeon is well-secured</strong> by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you <strong>turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise</strong>.<br/><br/>But what is that noise? <i>“Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!”</i> The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. <strong>The Dwarves have arrived</strong> to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart.<br/><br/>Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now <strong>bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-1_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Everything is better with Dwarves™:</strong> The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-2_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>It makes your Dungeon great again:</strong> Dungeons are up to four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-3_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Ripe for the taking:</strong> The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-4_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>New and shiny:</strong> An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-5_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Minions, everywhere:</strong> The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-6_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Many ways to tell the story:</strong> A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-7_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Change the world:</strong> Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-8_EN.png?t=1703077208"><br/><strong>Work together, slay together:</strong> 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2603740/extras/smol_egg.png?t=1703250755"><h2 class="bb_tag">Star in your own paleontology documentary!</h2> Atoms and Time is an evolution survival game with a strong scientific focus, powered by new technological advances in ecosystem simulation. Unlike other evolution simulators, Atoms and Time inserts you right into this world, filled with other species that adapt just as fast as you can. The story of your organism's survival is told in a simplified format inspired by games like Oregon Trail, skipping the wilderness-wandering and throwing you right into the highlights of your creature's life. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2603740/extras/bug_options.gif?t=1703250755"><h2 class="bb_tag">Advanced Evolution Prediction</h2>Playing through one organism's lifetime is fast, but the road of evolution is a long and complex one. Atoms and Time does not ask the player to wait around for an interesting mutation to randomly appear in your simulation, or provide the player unrealistic creative tools for character creation. Instead, the algorithm of "auto-evo" calculates the selection pressures that affect your species, given the current environment and known laws of biology. As the player, you get to choose one of a few scientifically plausible pathways to pursue. After that, it's up to you to survive with the tools given to you by nature.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can play Atoms and Time as a simulator, producing in seconds what other evolution simulators might take hours to accomplish. In addition, auto-evo allows the simulation to understand HOW a species is surviving, and why certain mutations were selected, providing a new window into the story of your simulated life.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

If you hit a block in your research, you can always ask for help, but are you ready to pay the price?<h2 class="bb_tag">Keep the balance.</h2> Don't let fame or fear get to your head. And remember: peasants have pitchforks and there's a lot of them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Plethora of endings.</h2> The multitude of potions and plot twists ensure high replayability.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In the tumultuous years of Albania's communist regime, ruled with an iron fist by Enver Hoxha, the country became an isolated fortress of strict Marxist-Leninist ideology. As Hoxha's government cut ties with the Soviet Union and later China, it isolated itself from the world, plunging its people into poverty and repression. In this atmosphere of paranoia and fear, Albania became a prime target for foreign subversion.<br>
<br>
Foreign intelligence agencies, including the shadowy operatives of the CIA and other Western powers, sought to undermine the Hoxha regime. They deployed covert agents and paratroopers into the heart of this isolated nation, attempting to sabotage infrastructure, incite uprisings, and gather intelligence. These foreign agents faced a relentless adversary in the form of the Sigurimi, Hoxha's feared secret police, and the ever-watchful eyes of the communist regime.<br>
<br>
The Albanian people, oppressed by decades of communist rule, lived in constant fear but also harbored a burning desire for freedom. The mountains and rugged terrain of Albania provided the perfect backdrop for clandestine operations, with isolated villages serving as hubs of resistance.<br>
<br>
As a player in this FPS multiplayer game, you'll step into the shoes of either a foreign subversive agent or an Albanian patriot, each with their own mission objectives. Will you infiltrate a key facility, engage in high-stakes firefights, or coordinate with fellow players to spark a rebellion against the oppressive regime? The fate of Albania and its people rests in your hands as you navigate the treacherous landscape of communism and foreign intrigue<br/>
<br/>
Here is an interesting story:<br/>
<br/>
It was 1945 when the communist party took over in Albania. Most of welthy people was murdered without a trial, their properties were confiscated, their families were jailed. Some of them went abroad leaving their families and properties in the communists hands. Years later, some of them trained and filled with anger, were mistakenly dropped in vicinity of Lushnja city south Albania. They were well armed and willing to kill the leader of communist party, Enver Hoxha. 3 of them were sent, but were far from the capital. So they dressed casually begun to walk toward the nearest city when stumbled a patrol of 2 police members in the beach. One of the three, shot a burst killing them instantly with a silenced scorpion.<br/>
<br/>
Took their guns and back pack. After that they saw the second patrol but one of the police patrol was in short pants since it was summer and he enjoyed fishing. Meanwhile the 2 groups were standing, watching curiously each other.... the one of the police patrol who was in uniform raised his gun but without any hesitation was bursted by the killers. The one who was in short pants stood there numbed without understanding the situation. They spoke in Albanian saying... "what are you doing here" he replied that he was fishing. It was like a nightmare, he still wasn't aware of the situation<br/>
<br/>
Later on, he remembers it was the only reason he was left alive, saying was there just fishing. Then they forced him to walk with them, one of them tied his arm with a wire. Poor guy was waiting to be killed. They went toward train station when.....<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to 'Crying Alone', a deeply personal and emotional game experience crafted from my own journey through heartbreak and healing. Spanning approximately 20 minutes, this story-driven platformer is not just a game, but a fragment of my life, transformed into an interactive narrative.<br>
<br>
In 'Crying Alone', you'll walk through the echoes of a relationship that profoundly changed me. Experience the raw emotions of waking up to a world turned upside down, the struggle to find footing amidst the chaos of loss, and the gradual path towards acceptance and self-discovery. Each level, each scene, each moment in this game is a reflection of my journey - from the depths of despair to the first glimmers of hope.<br>
<br>
As the developer and narrator of this story, I invite you to immerse yourself in a tale that's not often told, but deeply felt by many. This experience is for anyone who has ever loved and lost, for those who are navigating through the darkness of heartbreak, and for those who find solace in knowing they are not alone in their pain.<br>
<br>
Join me in 'Crying Alone', a journey of sorrow, introspection, and the slow, yet inevitable, healing that follows. This is more than a game; it's a piece of my heart, shared with you.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Envoy is a short physics based spaceflight game where you have been created by a monolith for the sole purpose of retrieving "force crystals" to it. Evade increasingly aggressive locals, utilize special abilities, all to complete your mission.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2561200/extras/envoygifa1.gif?t=1703199057"><h2 class="bb_tag">Your mission is to retrieve five force crystals to the monolith.</h2>Your sole and only purpose is to deliver force crystals back to a monolith. Weave and dodge around asteroids by utilizing realistic space physics, and have your flight somewhat regulated by a slight drag force applied when going too fast.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2561200/extras/envoygifa2.gif?t=1703199057"><h2 class="bb_tag">Locals have noticed your presence and will get more aggressive over time.</h2>You are not alone on your mission, and not in a good way. For some reason, locals don't want you to complete your mission and will do their best to stop you. The further you progress and longer you take, the more aggressive ships they'll send, ranging from police ships to military battleships.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2561200/extras/envoygifa3.gif?t=1703199057"><h2 class="bb_tag">Utilize various abilities to keep yourself safe from the locals.</h2>As you retrieve force crystals, you will unlock new abilities to utilize to make your mission easier. You can use them to outwit the locals, avoid an asteroid collision, or just accelerate the speed of your mission.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2561200/extras/envoygifa4.gif?t=1703199057"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survive as long as possible after completing your mission.</h2>Once the mission is complete, you have only one objective: survive. Utilize abilities and the skills you have learned to fight even more aggressive locals, as they throw their most powerful forces your way.<h2 class="bb_tag">Why is Envoy a free game?</h2>Envoy was made for the summer flowjam 2023 game jam, and is a free game available on the web. <br/>Additionally, it is being listed on Steam for free because it <strong><u>lacks</u></strong> the following:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Precise volume <i>(game can be muted)</i>, graphics, resolution, and keybinding settings.<br/></li><li>A pause menu.<br/></li><li>More than 30 minutes of gameplay.<br/></li><li>Support for controllers or users without a computer mouse.</li></ul><strong>Please be aware of these when downloading the game!!</strong> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>STORY</strong><br/><br/>A long and stressful day has Christopher drinking his problems away. But after he has one too many drinks, he passes out on the sidewalk outside of the bar. He wakes up in a strange, dark, and cold landscape with no sound but the howls of the night and song of the wind as it blows mountains of snow. He recognizes this  nightmare and is determined this time to get to the bottom of these strange fabrications.<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/><br/>Deep In The Snowy Night 2 brings back the "trial and error" style of the original, but with refined movement to make the game feel more realistic. You once again find yourself venturing through different environments. This time, a neighborhood, Town's square, Brewery, Snow marsh, a city and more. Your objective is to once again collect items to aid in your escape whilst trying to avoid being caught by whatever lurks nearby. DITSN 2 brings on new AI foes to go against while bringing back some familiar faces. As well as the newest feature, temperature.<br/><br/><strong>NEW FEATURE: TEMPERATURE</strong><br/><br/>Deep In The Snowy Night 2 presents a much colder climate. A number next to your stamina will display your body temperature (Starting at 98F). As time progresses, your temp will slowly fall with the rate depending on the level. Once your temperature drops to 95F, its game over. The ONLY way to prevent this is collecting Firewood throughout your mission and bringing 3 to a fire pit that will be present in every level. You can only carry 3 pieces of firewood at a time. Once lit, the fire will bump your temp back up to 98.						</div></div>]]></description>
