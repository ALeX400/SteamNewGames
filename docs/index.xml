      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">A lively parade with hololive VTubers and mascot characters!</h2><br/>"HoloParade" is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for "holo Indie". Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It's a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.<br/><br/>What is "holo Indie"?:<br/>It is a general term for a game brand for derivative work games, produced using the "game creator support program" with the aim of co-creating with fans and creators of hololive Production around the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 1: Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</h2>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy's base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's an element inspired by parades called the 'Symphony Effect,' where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Battle.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 2: Comprehensive Development Elements</h2>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a 'Skill' system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Skill_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 3: No Gacha Purchases, No Stamina System</h2>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.<br/><br/>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Gacha_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 4: Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</h2>When you return to the office, the home screen, you'll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Home_ENG.png?t=1701417555"><br/><br/>Additionally, mini-games with entirely different gameplay from the main story are implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. At the initial release, a mini-game titled "Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!" is available, where Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with hololive) who overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles. More mini-games are planned to be added in future updates.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/RunMikoti.gif?t=1701417555"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You are Harry Herman, an employee of Delta Laboratories who researches interdimensional traveling. You had been participating in a project that was supposed to benefit all humanity, but something went wrong. Through the gameplay, you will solve various physics-based puzzles using an energy-manipulating weapon, travel across space and time to explore surrealistic universes and find out the dark truth about this project and your connection to it.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_gameplay.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Solve various puzzles and trick enemies using physics interactions and your special tool - the Portable Energy Manipulator. <br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS PUZZLES &amp; INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gameplay_physics.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>Many objects in the game can be picked up, brought somewhere, or manipulated in other ways. Whether it's a computer terminal, a box you can carry, or a simple mug on a table. Explore various interactive environments to find clues and return to the riddle with a solution, which in some cases may be several. Nothing was made for you to solve, there's no cube dispenser or an obvious exit door at the end.

The heat energy from fire and radiators will melt glass, security cameras can be blinded by a beam of light, and for powering generators, you can take hazardous radiation from toxic puddles scattered across Delta Labs facilities. And of course, you will make an encounter with the quantum entanglement energy - the mysterious power capable of opening rifts between worlds. <br/><br/>Apart from solving environmental puzzles, your device can also be used against various creatures you'll meet in parallel dimensions. Most of the time you can't defeat your enemies; instead, you can use the Manipulator to outsmart or suspend them. Some enemies can be frozen in place using the force field energy, while others are sensitive to light and can be distracted by shooting a beam at it in the distance. You will require more advanced strategies and combining various energy types to pass them.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_story.png?t=1701271403"><br/>You find yourself in one of Delta Labs' off-world research facilities in an unknown dimension that looks more like a crashing-down laboratory.

You will learn different physics interactions and meet unusual creatures on your way home. Along this, you have to unveil the mysteries of this project and your past. <br/><br/>Experience a non-linear story where your choice always matters. Can you get to the bottom of this, or just try to escape? Who to listen? Who to trust? Which side will you take? And will you finally ‚Äúbreak the Principle‚Äù?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/voyage.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><i>It is the Year of Our Lord 2754‚Ä¶<br/><br/>You will never feel the sun‚Äôs warmth under a blue sky, never hear the wind in the branches of a tree, and never swim in the ocean, all because you had the misfortune to be born on the Ship, chained to a fate you didn‚Äôt choose. You have never seen Earth and you‚Äôll never see Proxima Centauri either. You‚Äôre doomed to live and die on the Ship in the name of the Mission, like your father before you, like his father before him.<br/><br/>The Ship is old. She had already been twenty years in service when she was rechristened Starfarer - a pretty name for a retrofitted interplanetary freighter. No one is certain the Ship will actually reach its destination, and nobody much cares, since no one alive now will live to see it. Might as well get on with your life and try to make the best of it.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/features_header.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Colony Ship is an isometric, party-based RPG inspired by Heinlein‚Äôs Orphans of the Sky. Your character's world is a ‚Äúgeneration ship,‚Äù a massive spacecraft on a centuries long voyage to colonize a distant planet. The Ship's original government has been disbanded following a violent mutiny and you must negotiate a treacherous path among your fellow passengers and the contentious factions striving to dominate the Ship. Your choices will determine who your friends and enemies are.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/explore.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Pit.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Your adventure starts in the Pit - a sprawling heap of vacant cargo containers slowly getting filled up with those who couldn't afford to stay in the Habitat or needed to get away from its bosses and factions. Out here, folks live free and die fast...<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>You open your eyes to a grey hull-metal ceiling, one panel of which flickers yellow, indicating dayshift. You overslept, not that it matters. With a grunt you roll off your stained mattress and open the "window" to let some fresh air in. Like everything else around here, fresh is relative. The Ship does its best to recycle air and water, but cargo holds aren‚Äôt high on Her priority list. You breathe in metal and burning oil and look up. Four of the bridge's six projectors are still operational, shining dully down on the container towers of Cargo Hold 3, better known as the Pit, the Free City.<br/><br/>Calling the Pit a city is a bit of a stretch, but so is calling this reddish-brown liquid water. You've read that water is supposed to be clear and cities are supposed to be big, but no ship-born has ever seen either. Maybe in another hundred years water will look and taste like oil and people will be talking about the good old days when it was the color of rust and tasted refreshingly bitter and tangy. That's the kind of optimism that keeps you going.<br/><br/>The elevator crawls up a groove in the cargo hold's wall like a black steel bug that's worn a path traveling to the bridge and back. It‚Äôs time to get up there and earn a few credits, but first you need a drink.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Hydroponics.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Once tasked with adapting Terran plants and grasses to the alien environment of Proxima Centauri, Hydroponics was abandoned during the Mutiny. Quickly overwhelmed by out-of-control mutant vegetation, it more closely resembles deep jungle than a research complex. In addition to the abnormal plants, oversized pest control species ‚Äìbioengineered to safeguard the colony's farmlands‚Äì are also on hand to punish the careless.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>Plants were sacred to the Founding Fathers. They represented our connection to Mother Earth, our sustenance, and our future. Picture rippling fields of wheat, rye, and barley to the horizon, mighty oaks and cedars, children eating apples right from the tree. That was the vision for Proxima.<br/><br/>But they didn't anticipate how many seedlings would fail in the Ship's simulated environments. And unless they found a way to make good those losses, it would be catastrophic. Alien fauna and poor soil were deemed the biggest threats, so they matched the most important plant species with customized, symbiont fungi. The latter were meant to act as pest killers. Unfortunately, the fungus did its job a little too well. We‚Äôre the pests now.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Habitat.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Before the Mutiny, the rooftops of the Habitat supported a sprawling amusement park. There, the people of the Ship could experience at least a few of the novelties they would never enjoy on Earth or Proxima: walk barefoot on real green grass ‚Äì courtesy of Hydroponics ‚Äì or soft, red-tinted 'Proxima' sand; sit under tall, artificial trees; and watch the sunrise on gigantic screens suspended all around. This last was said to be indistinguishable from the real thing, not that anyone aboard had ever seen it.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the three remaining rooftops are heavily fortified platforms, patrolled by armed guards. The sky-screens went dark long ago, a frivolous luxury in a decaying world. The grass underfoot and simulations of golden fields have likewise vanished, replaced by watchtowers and checkpoints. With enemies on all sides, cheap entertainment is a useless distraction from reality and its harsh demands.<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Mixed.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Armory - Among the stars, the children of Earth wish most of all for peace. Nevertheless, the wise prepare for every eventuality ‚Äì we should not survive long without the means to protect our territory and interests, with violence if every other method is exhausted. To that end, the Ship launched with a wide assortment of peacekeeping weapons and armaments, most of it looted and spent during the Mutiny and the hundred lesser skirmishes that followed.<br/><br/>Mission Control - The century-old wreckage of the Ship Authority government complex that once controlled every aspect of life on the Ship. Now scavengers infest this ancient seat of power, a grim reminder that nothing lasts.<br/><br/>The Shuttle Bay - Noah relied on doves to find a landing place, the Ship carried twelve survey shuttles for that same purpose. Even though the Shuttle Bay survived the Mutiny intact, it was looted in the interim, the life support systems and emergency supplies stripped, and the shuttle interiors used by generations of squatters. <br/><br/>The Factory - An abandoned industrial complex that once worked 'round the clock to produce tools for the Ship and the future colony. Why squander your precious shekels on second-hand Earth machinery, when your captive workforce will have three hundred years to manufacture everything you need?<br/><br/>And many others.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/gain.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Combat.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Combat is difficult. You‚Äôll be outnumbered and outgunned, so you‚Äôll have to figure out how to even the odds or avoid fights you can't win. There are 3 main factors determining the difficulty of any combat encounter and your character's life expectancy: Accuracy, Evasion, Damage (both dealt and taken). To succeed in combat, you must learn to control these factors. <br/><br/>Accuracy = 50 + bonuses from (stat + skill + feat + implant + helmet/goggles + weapon). You can easily neglect a couple of items from this list and still be a competent fighter, meaning you don't need to min/max your stats because it's only 1 item out of 6. The attacker's accuracy is further modified by the attack type (different attacks have different pros and cons), the weapon's gun's effective range, and inflicted penalties.<br/><br/>Evasion = bonuses from (stat + skill + feat + implant + armor handling ‚Äì armor penalty). The defender's evasion is further modifier by cover (the exact bonus depends on the angle), gadget bonus (i.e., using a Disruptor Field), and smoke/spore cloud (smoke grenades and certain critters). More detailed information can be found on the character and inventory screens (which show your accuracy and evasion), and in combat, where you can press ALT when targeting while targeting to learn what is affecting the accuracy of a particular attack.<br/><br/>The damage depends on both the weapon and the target's defense. Incoming damage is reduced by damage resistance (feat + implants + armor) and energy shield (gadget and/or energy armor). Weapons with good penetration and/or aimed attacks can reduce enemy's damage resistance, dealing more damage.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Stealth.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>When you enter the stealth mode all tiles are automatically assigned detection values, determined by the distance from the guards, which way they're facing, their Perception, and thermal vision gear, if any. Green - safe (you remain undetected), yellow - risky (if you end your turn there, you'll be spotted), red - instant discovery. High sneaking ability (modified by skill, feats, gear) turns more tiles green and opens up more options, whereas a low level thief might see nothing but yellow and red tiles. <br/><br/>Each step and action (lockpicking, climbing, using computers, killing guards in stealth mode, etc) generates noise. Not a whole lot of noise to instantly alert the guards the moment you do something, but enough to add up over time and raise the guards' suspicions. The higher the guards' Perception, the faster the alert bar is filled. An alerted guard turns towards the last noise generated, meaning a lot of safe tiles will turn red and if you're in the line of vision you'll be instantly discovered. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Dialogue.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>If fighting isn't you thing, you can avoid ALL combat by relying on speech skills: Persuasion, Streetwise, and Impersonate. Not every solution is in your face, but it is there. We check stats, skills, reputation, deeds, and track your choices to deliver appropriate consequences. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/friends.png?t=1701168231"><br/>Ten party members (max party size is 4) and well over a hundred different characters, some less friendly than others. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/001.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/002.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/003.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/005.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/008.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/007.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/015.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/006.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/harbinger.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/009.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/012.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/010.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/016.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/013.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/004.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/017.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><i>Lord's Mercy was her given name. Though he wasn't a priest, her father had called himself a Man of Scripture, and never tired of reminding his only child of God's wrath, His vengeance, His untiring thirst for retribution. If that‚Äôs what her name meant, Mercy did her best to live up to it.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>"Are you now?" Bartholomew looks at you with interest. "I assume you were on your way to the Habitat, but now you're stuck here...  Your odds aren't looking good, my friend,‚Äù he gives you a salesman's smile. ‚ÄúAttacking the Black Hand's stronghold is suicide, with or without our help. If Stanton loses...‚Äù He makes a pause, letting you work it out on your own.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><i>‚ÄúYou may address me as Harbinger. I no longer have a name." The bitterness in her voice is unmistakable. She must not have been doing this Harbinger thing for long. One of the guards removes his helmet to reveal an oddly leathery face with deep-sunk eyes and a lipless mouth. He grins as he savors your discomfort.<br/><br/>‚ÄúI wonder if the Neanderthals were as shocked by your outlandish appearance,‚Äù the woman says. ‚ÄúI wonder if they foresaw their own doom.‚Äù</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/join.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>A generation ship is a perfect ant-farm where different societies can coexist within a limited space, influencing and affecting each others' development while fighting for that limited space, which adds 'the end justifies the means' pressure. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/protector.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Protectors' one truth is the Mission, and the sole way to ensure successful completion of the Mission is to follow the Old Ways. The ways of the fathers, forefathers, and Founding Fathers are together the beam upon which the Ship travels to our ultimate destination. The mutiny, which through their steadfast and timely intervention was thankfully aborted, was the ultimate betrayal of the Old Ways, of everyone who had come before, the nullification of every sacrifice and every life dedicated to the Mission.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/brotherhood.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Brotherhood was formed to liberate the people from the iron shackles of the Ship Authority. Though their first sally -which the fossils of the old world denigrate with the term "mutiny"- failed to completely achieve this aim, the Brotherhood was successful in establishing themselves as a power to be reckoned with. The Brotherhood's initially pure goal, to free the enslaved wherever they may be, has unfortunately been sullied by the practical concerns of democracy. To bring freedom to the Ship entire must involve war, and no war may be won without sacrifice, nor may battles be managed by committee.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/church.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>As inevitably happens in dark and challenging times, some citizens turn to God for reassurance, the promise of an end to pain and hunger. Or failing an end, at least a purpose. The Church of the Elect rejected both the Protectors of the Mission and the Brotherhood of Liberty as worldly fools distracted by politics and their own egos. Teaching their adherents that they were chosen by God, the Church frames the journey of the Ship as a centuries-long test of faith. When the Ship arrives at her destination, Judgment Day awaits every citizen. The righteous will be welcomed into the Promised Land of Proxima Centauri, while the unrepentant will be returned to the Hell from which we fled - Earth - to suffer for all eternity.<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"/><br/>Plus lesser factions and groups: People of the Covenant (the mutants), the House of Ecclesiastes, formerly known as ECLSS - the Environmental Control and Life Support System, the Pit's Freemen, Thy Brother's Keepers, the Grangers, Jackson's Riflemen, and more!<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"/> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Raincouver: Infected Descent<br>

In the midst of the chaos, a beacon of hope emerges‚Äîa scientist who holds the key to a cure. Your mission expands beyond the rescue as you strive to find and extract this crucial figure. Every decision counts, as you balance the urgency of saving Raincouver with the pursuit of the elusive cure.<br>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The civilized world is no more, with only a horde of robots called Ancients roaming everywhere. The world is now only war and about is a battlefield. Alice is a mechanic who finds a malfunctioning tank AI on the battlefield. She repairs the AI, and together with AI, begins a journey to traverse the land of the Ancients, reaching the mythical end of the world!<br>
How to play:<br>
           -    Control the vehicle on the battlefield, find and reach the green-marked locations to move to the next map.<br>
-    In addition to the main mission, you also have a secondary mission on each map. It could be finding certain resources, escaping the battlefield within a set time, destroying designated targets, or destroying powerful Ancients of the enemy... Each map is a new experience!<br>
-    Destroy all Bunkers and ancients blocking your way!<br>
-    Collect resources, Fusion Core, Plasma Battery, and Nano Iron to upgrade and craft more weapons.<br>
-    Craft various gun towers: Novar, Plasma... for your vehicle!<br>
-    Equip additional weapons: Boom Plasma, Ground Mine, and Missile to destroy Ancients on the battlefield.<br/>
-    And, of course, upgrade your vehicle even stronger with many different upgrade paths!<br/>
-    Many enemy Ancients on the battlefield with different strengths that you must be careful to defeat.<br/>
-    Maps full of challenges, every enemy is very dangerous!<br/>
-    Simple and intuitive controls, move in four basic directions, and gun towers will move in the direction of your movement. If Ancients are nearby, your gun tower will automatically target them.<br/>
-    Shoot and switch weapons flexibly to destroy enemy Ancients, and make use of the items you've collected to repair your vehicle right on the battlefield.<br/>
-    You can start a new game as many times as you like, and all your resources, achievements, and upgrades will be reset!<br/>
<br/>
We hope "Alice and The Ancients" will give you a new experience, fill your leisure time, and help you have a pleasant time! Thank you for reading the introduction to "Alice and The Ancients!"						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Come back every day to solve the daily challenges or to tackle the weekly 16x16 megaboards! As you complete puzzle grids you will unlock new color palettes to change the mood of the game! (light and dark palettes are available from the start)<br>
<br>
You can stop playing at any time and continue your puzzle later. There is one save slot per difficulty which you may continue or reset at any time. The game plays entirely with the mouse.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to Goofy Gorillas, the largest (and greatest) nostalgia-driven virtual play centre!<br/><br/>Do you want to play Hide and Seek with your friends? Maybe you'd want to play Hide and Seek with dodgeballs, inflatable hammers and boxing gloves to raise the stakes a little more? Why not turn your friends into enemies in a free-for-all battle with all of the items mentioned? You and your friends can partake in these activities while also earning GP (Goofy Points). Levels are gained through earning GP, which can then be used to unlock unique cosmetic items to show off while you're winning in your game mode of choice!<br/><br/>If you just want to chill without the fear of being chased or you don't feel like turning your friends into enemies just yet, we have you covered! Goofy Gorillas prioritizes creating a social hub before any game mode begins, so you're able to do whatever you want to do - with small mini-games that can be played at any time too! <br/><br/>Goofy Gorillas is fitted with a football (soccer) pitch with a working score counter hidden within the play area, a bowling alley with two lanes also hidden within the play area, 2 large ball pits with large slides and there are some basketball hoops scattered around the entire venue - some easier to dunk than others! We hope there is something here for everyone!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAMEMODES</strong></h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Hide &amp; Seek</h2><br/>The classic game that everyone knows so well. Seekers must find all of the Hiders in the given time, and every round, both teams swap sides! Sounds simple, right? Well in Goofy Gorillas, we take it to the next level! Featuring an economy just for this gamemode, Hiders and Seeker have access to a shop with items and utility that will help them defend themselves as a Hider, or help catching the Hiders in style as a Seeker. <br/><br/>You want to make the Seekers slip on a banana peel? You can totally do that! <br/><br/>You want to hit the Hiders with an inflatable hammer? We highly encourage you to do that!<h2 class="bb_tag">Infector</h2><br/>Infector is another classic game. It plays just like Hide &amp; Seek, just without the economy. One player is chosen as the Infector, and by catching the Runners, they too will become an Infector. Once everyone has been caught, the Infector team will win... or lose if there's just a single player still standing. The first player that gets caught will be the Infector in the next round.<br/><br/>Be careful who you trust in this gamemode; once your "friend" has been caught, they will not be your friend anymore!<h2 class="bb_tag">Free For All</h2><br/>The standard of any multiplayer game. This is the perfect gamemode for those who want to mindlessly cause chaos with friends! Just spawn in with an item, get stuck in the brawl and come out on top, or just respawn with another item if you weren't successful! The first player to reach the score limit wins, or if no one reaches that, then the time limit will decide who becomes victorious!<br/><br/><br/>With all of these activities included, we hope you enjoy your time here at Goofy Gorillas!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							I am attempting to create a shooter experience tailored to our community's wishes. So what you see is what we all are looking for.<br>
<br>
Fast dynamic lateral movement and ideal projectile randomness incorporated with stylized animations which are generated dynamically via Unreal Engine's animation montage system, which by the way, is eye candy. <br>
<br>
We are using the Lyra shooter project as our base and as we go. I am planning to create customizable guns and characters along with providing stat based ranking and comparative match making.<br>
<br>
This will be the first game Ive created by myself so be aware Ill do my best to make this something good. This project was created for our community to have fun in a semi private way. As well this is a test of the unreal engines main shooter template LYRA which I'll be modifying as we go so updates will be a thing however I also know this thing is buggy! lol There are some audio glitching happening during respawns. Might just wanna turn that music volume down till I can get a fix for that.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is a basic third person shooter with a litany of baked in and ready to utilize features that over time I am going to learn and hopefully be able to modify and implement.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to point out that the networking system is janky ATM so we use Epic to run the game server hosting experience.<br/>
<br/>
All and all The game, so far, is functional and very small at a whopping 1.8 gigs<br/>
<br/>
So technically almost anyone can play it! <br/>
<br/>
Im hoping to have cross platform and VR worked out at some point in the future and honestly it could be working already however I have not been able to test it in that format yet. <br/>
<br/>
There are currently 10 maps included. Demon Station, Big Star Station, Convolution, Expanse, Space station, Soul Slum Forest, Soul Slum, Soul Cave, Shooter Gym and Overworld.<br/>
<br/>
There are currently 7 guns included. They are: Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle, Auto Sniper, Grenade, Grenade launcher, Rocket launcher.<br/>
<br/>
Health pickups are a thing as well.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the project and Thanks in advance for any form of feedback going forward.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
