As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709293292"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Explore bright, fictional Japanese streets filled with details and interesting objects to capture with your camera. Each photograph you take will translate the name of the content into Japanese and English so you can learn with your surroundings.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Take_Photo.gif?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A stylised, approachable 3D environment<br/></li><li>In-game photography system<br/></li><li>Japanese audio<br/></li><li>Photo album to store your flash cards<br/></li><li>A game mode that tests your memory<br/></li><li>Beginner phrases and grammar lessons<br/></li><li>Day/Night and weather cycle<br/></li><li>Display romaji, kana, furigana <i>(recommended)</i> or kanji</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Flash_Cards.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Create Stunning Photography Based Flashcards</h2>Every photo flash-card you take will be unique to you. The idea behind this is to strengthen the relationship between a word and how you see its physical appearance. In the real world, you can then see such objects and make connections to the Japanese words you've already learned while playing Shashingo.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1632490/extras/Shashingo_Photo_Album.png?t=1709246737"><h2 class="bb_tag">Track Your Progress in the Photo Album</h2>Your photo album is where you keep your collection of Photo Flash-Cards. If you remember them well in Find Mode, they'll be separated into the 'mastered' tab and shown with a gold star sticker. However, if you're struggling to remember a word in Find Mode, they'll be marked with a purple exclamation mark sticker, so you know which words you need to practice more.<br/>You can also mark your favourite words &amp; images with a cute little heart sticker to add them to your favourites page.<br/><br/>At the back of your in-game photo album, there are numerous pages of Japanese lessons designed for beginners that will teach you how to speak Japanese and use the vocabulary that you learn in Shashingo. Also included are some key words and important phrases that can help you in your future conversations.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2474880/extras/Divider1.jpg?t=1709304256"><br/><strong>Paint by Cubes</strong> is a colorful puzzle solving game. Take control of a painting cube and move in 4 possible directions, where each direction is locked to a particular color. Enter a field from a direction with a matching color to paint it and initiate special mechanics connected to it.<br/><br/>Start with simple levels consisting of 3 or 5 fields and watch as the difficulty increases as you progress through the more and more complex mechanics. Unlock new painting mechanics and carefully think about each step, as any misdirection may lead to a series of incorrectly matched paint colors.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2474880/extras/cubesGif1.gif?t=1709304256"><h2 class="bb_tag">MOVE TO PAINT</h2>The basic gameplay starts with a simple 4-directional movement. It may sound simple, but with each step taken your cube will spread a color related to the direction taken. Analyze the game area and plan your steps ahead as a wrong decision made at a crossing may cost you a series of excessive steps to fix it.<h2 class="bb_tag">100 COLORFUL LEVELS TO COMPLETE</h2>Start your adventure with levels requiring just a couple simple steps to complete and watch as the difficulty increases with your progress. Unlock new painting mechanics - from fields painting all row when you step on them, to unlockable gates blocking your progress and teleporters that make unpacking the level's layouts even more difficult.<br/><br/><br/>Test your skills in special, challenging levels, where you're limited by move limits or take control of multiple coloring cubes at once. Will you manage to finish them all?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2474880/extras/CubesGif2.gif?t=1709304256"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/title.png?t=1709280033"><br/><br/>You’re a hitman in one of the top three crime organizations fighting to the death over territory and the flow of illegal booze. It’s your job to follow orders and come out alive on the other side, no matter how risky, how brutal, or how unlikely it might seem that you’ll reach your mark. Jump, slide, sneak, or just barge right in – you’ll have to do whatever it takes to get the kill.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/mob_boss_takedown_cmprsd.gif?t=1709280033"><br/><br/><br/>As, <i>Of Murder and Moonshine’s</i> pixel art and dark, jazzy score give the game a gritty, nostalgic feel to punctuate the systematic killings you must carry out throughout cities and the bayou in order to appease your boss and ensure your crime syndicate comes out on top at all costs.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><strong>Choose your weapon</strong><br/>Start each level by choosing your preferred tool of the trade. From tommy guns to baseball bats, there’s a strategic choice for every situation.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Survey the task ahead or run in guns blazing </strong><br/>Depending on the scenario, you may employ a careful, covert operation where you survey the scene and plan out each step, or you may find yourself thrown right to the wolves and need to fight your way out from the inside. Either way, you have to take out your mark or find yourself on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661890/extras/shtgn_slide_store_page_ready_c.gif?t=1709280033"><br/><br/><br/><strong>Hide your intentions for covert hits</strong><br/>Alternate between brandishing your weapon and keeping it discreetly concealed in your overcoat to suit the situation at hand. You’ll never get to your mark and have an opportunity to take him down if you get stopped at the door by guards who see your intentions a mile away. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Expect to suffer for your mistakes</strong><br/>When you answer to the most ambitious crime boss the city has ever seen, you can’t expect to get any slack for sloppy work. The jobs you’re sent on are punishing, and you’ll pay with your life if you don’t succeed, but that risk is what makes victory taste all that much sweeter.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Take down killer bosses</strong><br/>When you’re part of a crime ring, it’s not only your own boss you need to worry about. Use what you’ve learned taking out lesser goons to bring down the big baddies—rival crime bosses who will do anything it takes to put an end to your mission. Boss fights mean tougher battles and bigger wins, so you’ll have to make use of new strategies, like employing molotov cocktails or honing your sniping skills, to take them down. Will you and your gang be able to conquer the swamps and the city, or will a rival crew bring you to your knees?						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
