Develop your early small settlement into a city bustling with life and dripping with gold. Build, develop, manage your resources and appease the Gods. Dominate other newly rising or existing settlements of other families through conquest or peaceful talks. Diplomacy or blood… it is your choice.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_1-Build_the_mightiest_and_most_expansive_empire_of_Yucatan.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Become the architect of your mythical city</strong></h2>As the Leader, you will be responsible for every building built on your territory, such as sawmills, temples, housing, barracks and many more. Skillfully plan your city as every path may play a vital role in managing your city. Well-planned zones of your empire will have a special impact on the proper and quickly develop your city. The fate of the citizens depends on you.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_2-Become_the_architect_of_your_mythical_city.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gather resources</strong></h2>There are many resources on your territory crucial for the development, conquest and keeping your empire stable. Some will be used for daily life, other resources will have a chance to become part of a variety of weapons – so vital to plan your skirmishes.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_3-Gather_resources.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Offer sacrifices to the Gods to earn their favor…</strong></h2>Without sacrifices, there is no game based on a mythical ancient tribe, right? God's favor is one of the basic and important quests in the game. Thanks to their approval your city will not only develop freely but also expand its borders and acquire greater military and political capabilities. Satisfy your Gods to avoid their wrath. You can make sacrifices through your Priest in places of worship such as temples. Choose an appropriate slave, organize a grand festival in honor of the chosen Deity and perform secret dark rituals to the delight of the audience. In return, you can expect divine protection from different cataclysms or an increase in yields from your farms and fields.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_4-Offer_sacrifices_to_the_Gods_to_earn_their_favor….gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>… or prepare for their wrath</strong></h2>Gold, riches, extraordinary development… it can’t be that easy. Each repeating or grand one-time festival requires sacrifices. If you happen to forget about worship, the Deities will send many cataclysms to your empire or other problems that will hinder your development. Some will be more or less taxing, but it is always better to evade a lone lightning bolt striking your home and setting the city ablaze or a huge tornado wreaking havoc in your city. Plan well what and when you offer your Gods as no mortal has survived their wrath.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_5-…_or_prepare_for_their_wrath.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Conquer and enslave neighboring people</strong></h2>Every gold is paid for in blood and war is the easiest way to get rich fast. Plunder resources, earn slaves and conquer new land needed for development. Gods are not the only worry, there are other peoples and tribes aiming for the same goal as you. Organize military expeditions, and reinforce the war front or defense lines with resources, which will help in your skirmishes with the enemy. Skillful resource management during war will have an impact on whether your people will come back as victorious conquerors bearing gifts or losers. Fight for the title of the mightiest ruler of the Golden City, El Dorado!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-Last.png?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Do not lose yourself in pride.</strong></h2> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

So, for now, familiarize yourself with the wasteland - you'll spend a lot more time in it when Outcast Tales is out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Be tactical</strong> (or mash buttons;  might work just as well)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Combat.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Robots, mutants, desert raiders: almost all enemies have something up their sleeve. So do your characters: some abilities are most effective in combination with others. Find your opponents' weaknesses, humiliate them on the battlefield, and never ponder the moral implications of your actions!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Use your strengths</strong> (if you can find any)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Chars.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Combine class and personality types to give each of your characters a unique set of abilities. A Preacher Mercenary and an Antihero Mercenary will behave quite differently. Create a balanced crew, or just try out the wildest combinations to see how they turn out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Overcome challenges</strong> (or mess everything up)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Events.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Your characters will encounter dozens of unique situations that test their skill and wits. The Pacifist might talk his way out of trouble, the Egghead might try setting up traps, and the Daredevil will most likely just start blasting! In Outcast Tales, there are no wrong answers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Develop relationships</strong> (like in a dating game, but not quite)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Relations.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Your characters can develop deep bonds or even fall in love - but can also come to despise each other, all depending on your actions. Your journey can become a wholesome story about newfound friendship, or a gruesome tale of three strangers constantly at each other’s throats. Whatever sounds more fun…						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705968827"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Billions of humans were crowded into overpopulated shelters, rife with disease and death. Just as their ancestors did so long ago, humanity looked to the stars for salvation. Using incredible technologies designed out of desperation, billions of people forged journeys into the darkness, establishing vast networks of interstellar colonies. The discovery of countless forms of alien life was met with indifference - an indifference that quickly turned to contempt. A powerful human military, honed by centuries of warfare, overpowered and conquered isolated alien worlds, claiming them as new territory for the massive human diaspora.<br/><br/>Humanity had avoided extinction and resettled itself, but had made a galaxy of enemies in the process. Survivors of countless fallen alien worlds banded together, and launched a suicidal campaign of revenge against the upstart race. All of humanity’s military and technological advances crumbled under the fury of an enraged galaxy, and soon, only a few million people remained, hidden in isolated pockets across the stars.<br/><br/>Once again faced with extinction, humanity turned to the tool that had brought them to the stars: innovation. But now, surviving military leaders were uninterested in saving lives or defending worlds. Their focus was far more singular - the eradication of everything. Terrible, reality-warping weapons were created by bending the very laws of nature. Captured alien species were spliced together and twisted into genetic abominations. Artificial intelligences were designed and built to brutalize their enemies, stripped of any ethical or moral restraint.<br/><br/>But there were a few dissenters. Not everyone believed that humanity’s last acts should be dedicated to nihilism. Some tried to reason with those in charge. Some refused their orders.<br/><br/>And a small number decided to act.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2425580/extras/PhogActionCroppedMoreOptimize.gif?t=1706759324"><h2 class="bb_tag">DEVELOPER’S NOTE:</h2><br/>Ex Vitro began its development many years ago as a tribute to one of the greatest games of all time: Super Metroid. I quickly realized any fangame would be squashed with legal trouble, so I shifted the graphics to my own design and tried to ride the line between ‘tribute’ and ‘knock-off’. It remains to be seen how successful I was, but as a solo developer, I learned a lot about game design in the process. It was the first game I started making, and it contains all of the lessons I learned along the way. Due to its origin, I feel that it’s unfair to charge for it. But I’ve included a bonus pack to go with it, if you want to support future development of new games by me!<h2 class="bb_tag">BONUS PACK INCLUDES:</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Instructions on how to build your very own Terrarium! (with special tips from the Facility Administration on how to care for genetic abominations)<br/></li><li>3 original music tracks by Sam Bionn<br/></li><li>High res concept art images of the character, final boss, and ending slides<br/></li><li>High quality wallpapers with various resolutions<br/></li><li>Royalty-free sprite sheets of unused graphics that never made it into the game, and behind-the-scenes descriptions of why they weren’t included<br/></li><li>8 Royalty-free tilesets of every environment from the game</li></ul> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up in a strange room, your mind is blank, and you can't remember anything except a fleeting residual image. You can only continue to accept the 'challenge' and explore why you lost your memory and why you are trapped here.<br>
<br>
"Janus Project" is a first-person perspective room escape game. The game is not big, but it does not mean that you can easily pass it. We are even considerate for players who really can't pass it. After many failures, you are given the option to jump directly to the level. Of course, we recommend that you challenge yourself.<br>
<br>
The whole game will burn your brain like crazy, and if you feel tired, what you should do is close the game and take a rest.<br>
<br>
After beating the true ending of the game, some levels in the main line will be unlocked in the trophy mode, and you can take on more difficult challenges than in the game.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Shards.</h2><br/><i>“They call me Rain without knowing my real name. Rainstorm is my only salvation.<br/>In this shattered world, where I have no friends or enemies... All I have to do is complete my contract and return — to find the one who's waiting for me.”</i><br/><br/>This is her only path: to willingly fall into the trap, in order to find and protect Lellia — at the behest of the contract given by an ancient Temple.<br/>Shards of destinies, endlessly intertwining threads of time; cycles that painfully replace each other... <i>Reflections in the eyes, scarlet — a color that outshines the hesitant flame.</i><br/><br/>These tests of fate will challenge you to figure out the traitor, protect Lellia, unravel the mystery of the magical catastrophe and the cycles of the “Modern Hell”.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1725910/extras/ForGifEn.gif?t=1706732263"><h2 class="bb_tag">A World Abandoned by the Gods.</h2><br/>The action takes place in the abandoned estate of the Order called “Black Rose”. A magical catastrophe has crushed the manor, spreading death to all nearby lands, turning people into “Shadows”. Rain will have to plunge into this cursed place, encountering a mad adventuress and a dragon-girl from the “Hel'” clan; in the darkness.<br/><br/>The dramatic story will unfold piece by piece, adding up to the overall picture of the dark mansion, reacting to your actions. Secrets, betrayals, a Railway beyond Space and Time...<br/>You'll go all this way with Rain. And it depends only on you — whether you can solve all the mysteries in time, solve everything without bloodshed... Or whether, on the contrary, you'll follow the scarlet path.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Path.</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>A non-linear plot that can change depending on your choices.</strong></li></ul>Build logic chains, decide: whether it's worth the risk, and what approach to choose for one or another character...<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>A dramatic story, not a dating sim.</strong></li></ul><i>“Nothing to worry about... If my blade turns out to be the slower”.</i> Feelings, logic and characters will be matter in this story.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>The world will not wait while you think about your actions.</strong></li></ul>A complex system that includes “TDA” moments, time-limited choices, and free-exploration moments — will allow you to experience the world of the visual novel as a living world, not just as the pages of a book.						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"> A battle chess game that even newcomers can quickly get started with </h2>The game has removed a large number of complex operations from battle chess games. Including character attributes, props, number of people, and so on. However, it does not reduce the operational requirements of the game, but rather allows players to make more choices with simpler operations. For example, players can summon and control enemy units to participate in battles. These units have abilities similar to player units. Players do not need to carry a large number of props, but can directly implement the same functions as props in map commands.<h2 class="bb_tag"> Prequel works </h2>I was originally creating a reset version for my first game, but due to the focus being on a more concise war chess game, I lacked experience and made this game to understand the situation. The characters on the cover are actually the ones that will appear in the remake.						</div></div>]]></description>

The Muffinski United Freedom Fighters (or MUFF for short) are determined to bring down our government.<br/><br/>Wouldn’t want to work for those guys...<br/><br/>In Sergei and the Tax Return you take control of your new business, using your old but still connected office computer you can give Sergei the jobs he needs to do as well as check the news and buy exciting upgrades, like new seatbelts!<br/><br/>You also have to check the Government Tax Return paperwork from other businesses around Muffinski, you start by checking the name of the business against the CEO name to make sure its correct, but before long you'll be checking which area they are from and what the yearly income and outgoings are.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, the phone will ring every now and then and maybe, just maybe MUFF are looking for help...						</div></div>]]></description>
