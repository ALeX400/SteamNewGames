Develop your early small settlement into a city bustling with life and dripping with gold. Build, develop, manage your resources and appease the Gods. Dominate other newly rising or existing settlements of other families through conquest or peaceful talks. Diplomacy or blood… it is your choice.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_1-Build_the_mightiest_and_most_expansive_empire_of_Yucatan.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Become the architect of your mythical city</strong></h2>As the Leader, you will be responsible for every building built on your territory, such as sawmills, temples, housing, barracks and many more. Skillfully plan your city as every path may play a vital role in managing your city. Well-planned zones of your empire will have a special impact on the proper and quickly develop your city.

Some will be used for daily life, other resources will have a chance to become part of a variety of weapons – so vital to plan your skirmishes.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_3-Gather_resources.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Offer sacrifices to the Gods to earn their favor…</strong></h2>Without sacrifices, there is no game based on a mythical ancient tribe, right? God's favor is one of the basic and important quests in the game. Thanks to their approval your city will not only develop freely but also expand its borders and acquire greater military and political capabilities. Satisfy your Gods to avoid their wrath. You can make sacrifices through your Priest in places of worship such as temples. Choose an appropriate slave, organize a grand festival in honor of the chosen Deity and perform secret dark rituals to the delight of the audience. In return, you can expect divine protection from different cataclysms or an increase in yields from your farms and fields.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_4-Offer_sacrifices_to_the_Gods_to_earn_their_favor….gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>… or prepare for their wrath</strong></h2>Gold, riches, extraordinary development… it can’t be that easy. Each repeating or grand one-time festival requires sacrifices. If you happen to forget about worship, the Deities will send many cataclysms to your empire or other problems that will hinder your development. Some will be more or less taxing, but it is always better to evade a lone lightning bolt striking your home and setting the city ablaze or a huge tornado wreaking havoc in your city. Plan well what and when you offer your Gods as no mortal has survived their wrath.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-GIF_5-…_or_prepare_for_their_wrath.gif?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Conquer and enslave neighboring people</strong></h2>Every gold is paid for in blood and war is the easiest way to get rich fast. Plunder resources, earn slaves and conquer new land needed for development. Gods are not the only worry, there are other peoples and tribes aiming for the same goal as you. Organize military expeditions, and reinforce the war front or defense lines with resources, which will help in your skirmishes with the enemy. Skillful resource management during war will have an impact on whether your people will come back as victorious conquerors bearing gifts or losers. Fight for the title of the mightiest ruler of the Golden City, El Dorado!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2410890/extras/El-Dorado-Last.png?t=1706714077"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Do not lose yourself in pride.</strong></h2> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

So, for now, familiarize yourself with the wasteland - you'll spend a lot more time in it when Outcast Tales is out!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Be tactical</strong> (or mash buttons;  might work just as well)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Combat.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Robots, mutants, desert raiders: almost all enemies have something up their sleeve.

The Pacifist might talk his way out of trouble, the Egghead might try setting up traps, and the Daredevil will most likely just start blasting! In Outcast Tales, there are no wrong answers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Develop relationships</strong> (like in a dating game, but not quite)!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/882590/extras/OT-GIF-Relations.gif?t=1706689310"><br/><br/>Your characters can develop deep bonds or even fall in love - but can also come to despise each other, all depending on your actions. Your journey can become a wholesome story about newfound friendship, or a gruesome tale of three strangers constantly at each other’s throats. Whatever sounds more fun…						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"> A battle chess game that even newcomers can quickly get started with </h2>The game has removed a large number of complex operations from battle chess games. Including character attributes, props, number of people, and so on. However, it does not reduce the operational requirements of the game, but rather allows players to make more choices with simpler operations. For example, players can summon and control enemy units to participate in battles. These units have abilities similar to player units. Players do not need to carry a large number of props, but can directly implement the same functions as props in map commands.<h2 class="bb_tag"> Prequel works </h2>I was originally creating a reset version for my first game, but due to the focus being on a more concise war chess game, I lacked experience and made this game to understand the situation. The characters on the cover are actually the ones that will appear in the remake.						</div></div>]]></description>

In Multiplayer Modes, this gives Players multiple ways of competing against or with each other as well as diverse forms of achievements and challenges, in Single Player modes this will either serve as creative challenges for the Story Dungeon or interesting obstacles or tasks for each consecutive round in other Single Player modes.<br/><br/><u>Weapons:</u><br/>With 5 weapons to choose from there is never a dull moment in a round of Booom-Slang! Whether it's the Plasma Rifle for pinpoint accuracy and those deadly kill-shots, the Plasma Shotgun for those spots that just a little bit too crowded, the Plasma RPG when you like to 'live dangerously', the Plasma Sword to get up close and personal or the Plasma Grenade when you just feel like leaving someone a present ;)<br/><br/><u>Power-Ups:</u><br/>Hunt Creeps for Points, Collect Treasure, Trade in Resources for Power-Ups, what could be more natural! Protect your vulnerable bag of skin from things like Lava Pits and Rabid Wolf Bites with the Plasma Shield. Burn your enemies (or yourself, lol) with a conjurable Pit of Fire! Hop over those pesky high arena walls and barriers with the Rocket Jump or bring down judgement with a FRICKEN LIGHTNING STRIKE!!! Yeah!!!<br/><br/><u>Abilities:</u><br/>Where would one be without Abilities? Truly one of the Universe's most important questions. That's why we gave ya a Teleporter, cause gee golly whizz it sure is neat watching your character zipping and zooming across the screen, ain't it?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							As you work through a level, your past moves are stored in a move history. When you move in the pattern “direction, direction, opposite direction, direction” (for example up, up, down, up) you perform a happy jump which flings you three places instead of one. Things start to heat up when different blocks get introduced that serve as both obstacles and advantages. Walls are the simplest block. You can’t walk through them and have to happy jump over them. Pause blocks are tricky buggers. You can walk inside of them, but the move you make into them is not counted in your move history. The move you make out of the block is counted! Break blocks are the opposite. You can’t walk inside a break block, but running into it will add to the move history even though your player stays in exactly the same spot. Move blocks can be pushed around to clear a path or used in tandem with break blocks to make some crazy moves possible.<br>
<br>
There are currently 39 levels! I hope you have as much fun playing them as I have had making them.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>
