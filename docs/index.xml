      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2511500/Dominions_6__Rise_of_the_Pantokrator/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705083406"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705083406"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>J and the Sewer World</strong> is a 2D platforming game with a pixel art style inspired by classic games from the 80's and 90's. Developed in <strong><u>Game Maker Studio 2</u></strong> for the first time, the game incorporates nostalgic elements of the video game era.<br/><br/>The story follows J, a boy who, while playing soccer with his friends at the neighborhood field, accidentally kicks the ball into the sewer's manhole. His friends, annoyed with the loss of the ball, push J into taking responsibility and retrieve it. Upon entering the sewer, J discovers that the ball is not where he imagined, thus initiating his journey to find it. While exploring the sewer filled with creatures like Slimes, Flies, Toe-Biters, and Catfishes, he encounters several hardships.<br/><br/>Across 4 distinct stages inside the sewer, filled with enemies and bosses, J interacts with several NPCs who call the sewer home, some of whom give valuable tips to overcome the challenges.<br/><br/><strong><u>GAMEPLAY:</u></strong><br/>In the game, the player assumes control of <strong><u>J</u></strong>, making use of simple commands, like moving right and left, jumping, and attacking with the slingshot, which fires rocks. The challenge lies in exploring the area, fighting enemies and bosses while interacting with the residents of the sewer on the quest for the precious soccer ball.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to an immersive trading simulation experience. In this game, the dynamics of financial markets are realistically replicated in a safe, virtual environment. Utilizing real market data, it offers a lifelike trading experience, suitable for both seasoned traders and beginners.<br/><br/>The game is managed through a user-friendly client on your PC. This allows you to test and refine your trading strategies in a setting that simulates real markets, but remains virtual.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Quick Start Guide</strong></h2><br/>Embark on your trading journey with this straightforward guide. The interface is crafted to mirror the complexities of real-world trading platforms, while remaining intuitive and user-friendly. Key features are highlighted and explained for easy understanding.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Starting Up</strong>: Launch the game client to open the main window, which can be moved, resized, and minimized.<br/></li><li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Use point-and-click mechanics for navigation, compatible with both mouse and touchscreen.<br/></li><li><strong>Selecting a Trading Symbol</strong>: Choose a symbol, for example, Solana (S), to view its price charts, trading buttons, trading costs, margin requirements, bid/ask spread, as well as your open positions and overall trading performance.<br/></li><li><strong>Understanding the Interface</strong>: Refer to the annotated image below, which explains key functions and interface elements.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2754770/extras/custom_2.png?t=1705912108"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Base Game vs Downloadable Content (DLCs)</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Price History</strong>:<br/>The base game, free to play, provides real-time market data and 24 hours of price history for all trading instruments (cryptocurrencies) in-game. For extended price history, consider the History+ DLC for $5 USD (or your local currency equivalent). This DLC broadens your price history access to 7 days. More details can be found on the History+ DLC store page.<br/></li><li><strong>Order placement</strong>:<br/>The base game allows for market buy (▲) and sell (▼) orders, and includes buttons to close all your open positions (💰 = close at a profit, 🔥 = close at a loss, ❌ = close at breakeven). These features are free and provide full manual control for trading with all instruments.<br/>For an enhanced trading experience, consider the Auto⚙️Trading DLC, priced at $15 USD (or the equivalent in your local currency). This DLC not only offers limit orders and automated trading, but also comes with stop loss orders for enhanced risk management. Detailed information on this DLC can be found on its specific store page.<br/></li><li><strong>Trading Instruments</strong>:<br/>The base game includes 14 cryptocurrencies with 50x leverage. For traders seeking more variety and a greater challenge, the +25 Trading Instruments DLC, priced at $20 USD (or your local currency equivalent), adds 25 additional cryptocurrencies with 25x leverage each, increasing the total number of tradable in-game instruments to 39. More details about this DLC can be found on its store page.<br/></li><li><strong>Trading Capital</strong>:<br/>Since trading requires capital (also known as 'margin' in leveraged trading), the base game includes a starting capital of 1K credits, equivalent to $1000 USD, simulating the typical starting point for many new traders. For those willing to take more risk, three additional Trading Margin DLCs are available, each permanently increasing your margin significantly.<br/>You can increase your margin by 10K credits for $10 USD, by 29K credits for $20 USD, and by 59K credits for $30 USD (or the equivalent in your local currency).<br/>To maximize your trading margin, you can purchase all three Trading Margin DLCs, boosting your total trading margin to 99K credits (base 1K + 10K + 29K + 59K). You won't lose this increased margin if you decide to reset your account; each DLC simply increases your starting capital. Further details can be found on the respective Trading Margin DLC pages.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>No Pay-to-Win Mechanics</strong></h2><br/>Simply put, without a solid trading strategy, a lot of patience and a bit of luck,<br/>you won't be winning in this game, no matter how many DLCs you buy. <br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Price History</strong>:<br/><strong>+</strong> Benefits: Having access to extended price history is a substantial advantage for players looking to analyse market trends more deeply. It allows you to review longer-term market movements and patterns, which can be crucial in developing a more comprehensive trading strategy. With a broader historical perspective, you're better equipped to identify potential trend reversals, long-term market cycles, and key support and resistance levels.<br/><strong>-</strong> Considerations: However, it's important to remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Market behaviour is inherently variable and can shift unexpectedly due to a myriad of factors such as economic changes, geopolitical events, sudden market news, or significant actions from major market players, commonly known as 'whales'. These large investors can have a substantial impact on market movements by entering or exiting positions, which can significantly influence price trends and volatility.<br/></li><li><strong>Auto-Trading</strong>:<br/><strong>+</strong> Benefits: Automated trading, when executed with a robust strategy, can significantly enhance your trading efficiency. It enables the execution of trades with speed and consistency challenging to achieve manually. Additionally, it helps maintain trading discipline by reducing the emotional impact of trading decisions, emphasizing more on planning and monitoring rather than frequent manual clicking. The addition of stop loss functionality in our Auto-Trading DLC further enhances risk management by allowing traders to set predetermined loss thresholds, ensuring better control over potential losses.<br/><strong>-</strong> Considerations: However, the convenience of automated trading comes with its own set of risks. It's crucial to remember that no strategy is infallible, and relying solely on automation can lead to rapid losses, especially if the system continuously adds to losing positions. Regularly monitoring and adjusting your strategy in response to changing market conditions is essential. The stop loss feature, while mitigating some risks, should not lead to complacency. It's vital to be aware of these risks and not to use auto-trading as a substitute for a thorough understanding of the markets and a well-thought-out trading plan.<br/></li><li><strong>More Trading Instruments</strong>:<br/><strong>+</strong> Benefits: The addition of 25 new cryptocurrencies nearly triples the number of trading instruments, enhancing the game's strategic depth and complexity. This broadens your trading options and introduces a more nuanced trading environment, encouraging the development of diversified and sophisticated strategies.<br/><strong>-</strong> Considerations: While having access to a larger pool of trading instruments can be advantageous, it also introduces increased complexity and the potential for overtrading. Monitoring 39 different instruments requires more attention and can be overwhelming, especially for less experienced traders. This complexity can lead to missed opportunities or misjudgments in market trends. Additionally, trading across too many instruments can result in spreading your capital too thin, reducing the effectiveness of each trade. It's crucial to be disciplined and selective in your trading choices to avoid diluting your focus and capital. The challenge lies in balancing the temptation to trade more with the need for strategic, well-researched decisions.<br/></li><li><strong>More Capital</strong>:<br/><strong>+</strong> Benefits: Increasing your trading capital enhances your ability to trade in larger volumes, which can be a significant advantage in the game. With more capital, you have the flexibility to diversify your trades across different instruments, potentially increasing your gains. It also allows you to sustain larger drawdowns without exhausting your resources, giving you more room to maneuver and strategize in the dynamic market environment.<br/><strong>-</strong> Considerations: However, it's important to remember that more capital also equates to increased risk. While you have the potential to achieve higher profits, the possibility of facing amplified losses is equally real. Increasing your investment capital doesn’t automatically translate into proportional increases in profits. It's crucial to manage this capital wisely and not to fall into the trap of overconfidence. Trading decisions should always be based on well-thought-out strategies and not on mere speculation or hope.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Timeframes and Price Charts</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>When you start the game and select a trading symbol, look at the top left corner of the game client. You'll see a large blue number 5, accompanied by ▲ and ▼ icons. This number represents your selected timeframe in minutes, impacting the main symbol price chart at the center and your score chart at the bottom. The smaller chart at the top covers a 6 times longer time period than the main chart by using half-sized price candles and a timeframe that is 3 times longer. Note that the mini-charts in the symbols list are fixed and always display minute-by-minute price movements from the past 25 minutes.<br/></li><li>Adjust your timeframe with ease by clicking or tapping the ▲ or ▼ icons. This action changes all charts to match the new timeframe. You have a variety of timeframes at your disposal, ranging from 1 to 60 minutes, including intermediate options like 3, 5, 15, and<br/>30 minutes, allowing for detailed or broad market analysis as per your preference.<br/></li><li>The chosen timeframe affects the data in each price candle. These candles, thick vertical lines colored red and/or green, visually represent the price movement over time. They show the price change from the past (left side) to the present (right side).<br/></li><li>For instance, a 1-minute timeframe means each price candle on your main symbol chart shows price movements within a single minute. This provides a detailed, minute-by-minute view. On the other hand, a 15-minute timeframe means each candle represents a<br/>15-minute period, offering a broader, more summarized view of price changes.<br/></li><li>Longer timeframes offer valuable insights into extended price movements, maintaining the same candle thickness for consistency. This approach is similar to zooming in or out on the price chart. However, instead of changing the physical thickness of the candles, it adjusts the density of the information each candle represents. By doing so, it allows for a clearer understanding of market trends over a longer period without cluttering the chart, ensuring that each candle delivers a comprehensive snapshot of price activity within its timeframe.<br/></li><li>In this game, the shortest timeframe is one minute. Keep an eye on the Server clock in the top right corner as you watch the price charts. As each minute ends, indicated by the seconds changing from 59 to 0, all price charts update accordingly.<br/></li><li>This chart update shifts data from the oldest minute in each candle to the preceding one, making room for the newest minute's data in the candle on the far right. For example, if you choose a 15-minute timeframe, the candle on the far right of your chart continuously receives new information. It displays what happened in the last 14 minutes and keeps adding data from the current minute. This ensures that the rightmost candle on all charts, regardless of their timeframe, always reflects the most recent price changes, keeping you informed about the latest market developments in real-time.<br/></li><li>Selecting a longer timeframe ensures consistent data condensation across the entire chart, providing a comprehensive view of price movements over your selected timeframe. Our design, while different from the traditional "Japanese" candlesticks, complements their established method. Japanese candlesticks, used widely in trading platforms, efficiently represent price movements within a specific period, showing opening, high, low, and closing prices, with color indicating the price trend (green=up, red=down). Our design builds on this concept, allowing players to see the continuous flow of price movements.<br/></li><li>This design is intended to offer dynamic and real-time market analysis, enhancing player engagement. It encourages adapting to a new style of chart analysis and developing strategies specific to this game. Although there's a learning curve for those accustomed to traditional methods, it adds a fresh dimension to the gameplay and complements the dynamic nature of the markets.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Margin and Order Management</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>What is Margin?</strong><br/>Margin is the capital that the broker reserves in your trading account for buying or selling instruments on leverage (or 'margin trading'). Leveraged trading means borrowing from the broker to potentially increase gains and risks. To ensure that you won't lose more money than you actually have, the broker allocates a portion of your capital when you open a position (this is your 'required margin') and starts automatically closing your losing positions if you run out of capital (a process known as a 'Margin Call').<br/></li><li><strong>Margin Call</strong>:<br/>You have the ability to open various positions in multiple trading instruments, as long as there is enough capital, referred to as free Trading Margin, in your account. If your Trading Margin depletes (becomes red and drops below zero), the game's client will initiate a Margin Call. This simulates a scenario where the Broker needs to close your positions to prevent losses from exceeding your available capital. Positions will be closed based on their impact on your losses and margin usage, starting with those incurring the biggest losses and requiring the most Margin to stay open.<br/>This feature is included in the base game but requires the game client to be running for Margin Calls to be executed properly. If you leave your positions open and close the game client, while your losses continue to accumulate due to prices moving against your open positions, don't be surprised if a Margin Call is triggered when you next start the game.<br/>This could result in your simulated trading account showing a loss that exceeds your total capital. In such a case, you should consider resetting your account. Steps for resetting your account can be found below.<br/></li><li><strong>Market vs Limit Orders</strong>:<br/>Market orders and limit orders are two fundamental types of orders used in trading.<br/>A market order is executed immediately at the current market price. When you place a market order, you are essentially saying you want to buy or sell a security as quickly as possible at the best available current price. This type of order guarantees execution but does not guarantee the execution price.<br/>In contrast, a limit order is set to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. With a limit order, you specify the maximum price you're willing to pay when buying, or the minimum price you're willing to accept when selling. This type of order gives you control over the price at which the trade is executed, but it does not guarantee that the order will be filled. Limit orders are executed only if the market price meets your requirements.<br/></li><li><strong>Opening Positions</strong>:<br/>Opening a position, either through a market or limit order, increases margin requirements and decreases free margin. Running low on margin may trigger a Margin Call. Your available and your free margin are also directly affected by your trading results, which include your closed as well as your open positions. When your loss grows, your available margin decreases by the same amount. Consequently, when your profits grow, your available margin will be increased by the same amount.<br/></li><li><strong>Reducing required Margin</strong>:<br/>To reduce margin requirements, you can either close existing positions or reduce your open volume by trading in the opposite direction (buy if you're selling, sell if you're buying). Closing all positions on an instrument using the FLAT button (💰|🔥|❌) also affects your Locked Margin: closing at a loss (🔥) reduces it, closing at a profit (💰) increases it.<br/></li><li><strong>Withdrawals / Decreasing Trading Margin</strong>:<br/>Use the down button (▼) next to Locked Margin to decrease your Trading Margin, transferring funds from Available to Locked Margin. This action, similar to a withdrawal, lowers your available funds and drawdown limit, reducing your risk. The use of this feature is possible only when your Free Trading Margin is green and positive. Should your Trading Margin become red and drop below zero, the game client will initiate a Margin Call.<br/></li><li><strong>Deposits / Increasing Trading Margin</strong>:<br/>Increase your Trading Margin by using the up button (▲), moving funds from Locked to Available Margin. This, akin to a deposit, raises your available funds and drawdown limit, increasing your risk. The use of this feature is possible only when your Locked Margin is green and positive. If your Trading Margin becomes red and drops below zero, the game client will initiate a Margin Call (see detailed explanation above).</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Resetting Your Account</strong></h2><br/>Need a fresh start? Easily reset your SIM💾Trading Account through a simple, safeguarded process. Just navigate to the interface's bottom-right and follow the straightforward steps, designed to prevent accidental resets. Your increased margin from DLCs remains intact.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>To close open positions with a profit (positive PnL), simply click the 'ALL FLAT' button.<br/></li><li>If your open PnL (profit/loss) is negative, clicking the same button will prompt you to address the symbol with the largest loss. The symbol will be automatically selected, allowing you to close it manually. This is a safety feature, to avoid accidental closure of all positions in a loss with one click.<br/></li><li>With all positions closed and your account 'ALL FLAT', click the 'ALL FLAT' button four more times. Each click is a step towards resetting your account, with clear confirmations along the way. After the fourth click, your account will reset, and you’ll start anew, just like on your first trade day.<br/></li><li>If you have purchased and enabled one or more of the Trading Margin DLCs, then your initial Margin will be increased by the number and combination of DLCs purchased and enabled. Refer to the respective DLC pages for details.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Disclaimers, Privacy Policy, and Data</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Not a Broker / Not a Financial Advisor</strong>:<br/>The developer of this game is neither a broker nor a financial advisor. Nothing found here should be considered financial advice or seen as an endorsement to start trading on real markets. This game on Steam exists solely for entertainment and educational purposes. Results from simulated trading cannot and should not be compared to potential results when trading on real markets. Your simulated transactions do not affect the real market in any way, while transactions on real markets are the primary drivers of price movements.<br/></li><li><strong>Privacy Assurance</strong>:<br/>We value your privacy. While the game requires an internet connection to access data from our Server, it was designed to ensure that no user-identifiable information is transmitted from game clients the Server.<br/></li><li><strong>Anonymized Data Access</strong>:<br/>When starting the game via Steam, the client loads content anonymously and requests a Server-generated random 256-bit sequence as an account ID. Consequently, the game client utilizes this anonymized, Server-generated ID for accessing real-time market data.<br/></li><li><strong>Transactions and Gameplay Data</strong>:<br/>The game client does not send any data about you, your purchases, or your gameplay activities to our Server. All DLC purchases and achievement tracking are managed directly between the game client and the Steam client running on your PC, ensuring the privacy and security of your personal and gameplay-related data.<br/></li><li><strong>Fast and Secure Connection</strong>:<br/>For enhanced efficiency and security, communication between the game client and our Server is facilitated through the HTTP/2 protocol, secured with SSL encryption, utilizing a single connection and using SSE (Server-Sent-Events) for streaming real-time market data from each Server to all connected Clients. This modern approach ensures fast and reliable data transfer while maintaining high standards of data privacy and security.<br/></li><li><strong>Technology and Transparency</strong>:<br/>Our game uses NW.js (previously known as node-webkit) and the Steamworks SDK for integration with Steam. The game client is written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and the code is intentionally kept unobfuscated to maintain transparency and security.<br/></li><li><strong>Market Data Source</strong>:<br/>The raw market data required for this game is sourced in real-time from a well-established financial broker, accessed via their publicly available API. The use of this real-time data is solely to provide a realistic and immersive gaming experience.<br/></li><li><strong>Data Streaming Process</strong>:<br/>Our Servers receive this raw market data in real-time from the broker, using a single WebSocket connection per Server. After establishing this connection, the Server subscribes to the broker's data feeds required by the game. The broker then sends their data and updates in real-time to the Server, at their own pace. This method ensures that we do not overload the broker’s Server. Our Servers process this data to prepare everything required for game clients, package and compress it to minimize outgoing traffic, then distribute it to connected clients, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow.<br/></li><li><strong>Server Capacity and Scalability</strong>:<br/>Our Game Servers are designed to each support up to 10 thousand concurrent users. We are starting with two Servers at launch, which should ensure a stable and responsive gaming experience from the beginning. In anticipation of increasing player demand, we are prepared to scale our infrastructure to maintain high performance and reliability. We have opted against using a single central Server, to eliminate the risk of the central Server becoming a bottleneck. Instead, each client decides which server to use. Please report any connectivity issues through our Steam community pages or by email.<br/></li><li><strong>Dedicated Simulation Server</strong>:<br/>The Steam version of our game operates on separate Servers, exclusively designed for Steam and simulated trading. This ensures that our game on Steam, both the client and Server-side, is dedicated solely to providing a realistic yet entirely simulated trading experience. Please note that, while inspecting the game code, you may come across references to DEMO and REAL trading. These are parts of our shared codebase used in other products. For the Steam version of our game, these features are not applicable.<br/></li><li><strong>Market Data Quality and Availability Disclaimer</strong>:<br/>We aim to provide continuous and accurate market data for educational and simulated trading purposes. However, the quality and availability of that data rely on the broker's service, which is beyond our control. The data is accessed via a publicly available API and provided 'as is', for informational use only. Please note that we cannot guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of market data, and can not be held responsible for any unavailability or inaccuracies. Also, please be aware that the range of trading instruments featured in our game is based on the current offerings available through the broker's API. Should the broker alter or remove any of these instruments from their API, our game will be updated to reflect these changes. We cannot guarantee the continuous availability of any specific trading instrument in the game.<br/></li><li><strong>Affiliation Disclaimer</strong>:<br/>Neither this game nor its developer and publisher are affiliated with, endorsed by, or in partnership with any financial broker, trading service, or platform.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Start Issues</strong>:<br/>If you can't see the game window after launching it from Steam, first check your taskbar to see if the game is running there. If not, open the Task Manager (you can do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and selecting Task Manager) and look for a process named 'nwjs', which is the engine running our game client. Close this process and then try relaunching the game from Steam. If the game still refuses to launch, please contact our support, either through our Steam community pages or by email.<br/></li><li><strong>Internet Connection</strong>:<br/>The game cannot be played offline. It uses real-time market data from our Server, making an active connection crucial for gameplay. Without an internet connection, the game won't load and market data won't be updated. If your connection drops, the game will automatically try to reconnect.<br/></li><li><strong>Connection Troubleshooting</strong>:<br/>In case of persistent connectivity issues, press F5 to reload the game. If this does not resolve the issue, troubleshooting instructions will automatically be displayed. If the instructions don't appear and the game fails to load, first check your internet connection and ensure that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking the game. If the problem persists, restart the game client through Steam. For further assistance, please contact our support, either through our Steam community pages or by email.<br/></li><li><strong>DLCs Not Working</strong>:<br/>If the DLCs you've purchased do not appear in-game, press F2 to see your Steam nickname in the game's title bar. Ensure this nickname matches the account used for purchasing the DLCs. If there's a mismatch, quit the game and Steam, log into the correct account, verify that the DLCs are enabled, and then restart the game. Pressing F2 toggles the display of the nickname, which is hidden by default to protect your privacy. This is useful when streaming or recording for a public audience. *If you have not set a separate nickname, your "persona" name will be shown instead.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Questions/Feedback</strong></h2><br/>Feel free to reach out with feedback or questions through our Steam community page.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Everyone yearns for immortality, and for ordinary people, the most coveted place is undoubtedly the Cultivating Immortals, a place of cultivation. It is said that the Cultivating Immortals was divided into eighteen territories by demon forces, where fairy grass was everywhere and demons were rampant. Therefore, this place became a paradise for cultivators. There are often powerful cultivators here who practice hard and eventually soar to the sky. This place not only contains treasures left by the ascending sages, but also those cultivators who bravely died here for immortality. Perhaps you will bravely kill demons due to a spiritual herb, a secret script, or a relic, or compete with your companions for resources. No matter what method you choose, you will embark on an unprecedented adventure where you will learn about Taoism, practice demon killing, and treasure hunting, all for the ultimate goal of immortality. Let's jointly uncover the veil of this mysterious land!<br>
<br>
Cultivating Immortals is a multiplayer cultivation competition game.<br>
<br>
The current version has launched single person cultivation mode and multi person interaction scenes. Including: lifespan system, realm system, combat system, magic system, boss system, drop treasure system, Chat system, legacy system, and multi scenario PVE.<br>
<br>
In the later stage, it will be open: mount system , multi scenario PVP, larger magical system, weapon system, equipment system, managed auction house, alchemy system, sect system, multi universe system, creation of small world system, etc<br/>
<br/>
This is currently the first version, and the game will be updated five times to present exciting content to players.<br/>
<br/>
Current version: Mainly aimed at improving cultivation by collecting herbs, eliminating low-level monsters to obtain fairy magic secrets, learning advanced fairy magic, and then going to eliminate high-level monsters.<br/>
At present, the multiplayer mode has poor support for non China regions, which may result in inability to connect to the server, causing both parties to be invisible.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							One day you had the bad luck to fall through from your reality into some otherworld. Such incidents sometimes happen and now it has happened to you. From now on you have only one task - to find 8 pictures and leave this strange place. <br/>In terms of gameplay Eyes Of Memes is a classic indie horror in which you have to explore the location in search of pictures.  You don't have any weapons, you are always defenseless against the inhabitants of the place and if you encounter them, running away is the only way to escape.<h2 class="bb_tag">Levels</h2>You just went to sleep in your cozy bed in your home and when you wake up you find that you are in some dark creepy place... There are 6 levels available to you in the game: Morgue, School, Basement, Game Room, Backrooms and Desert.
