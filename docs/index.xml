<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The Void. The Matter. The Megastructure. A dystopian world with an egomaniac leader determined to unveil the secrets of the universe.

							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich.

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header_alt_assets_1.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/01_risk_of_rain_is_back.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Carefully designed, beautifully remastered, and loaded with new ways to play—Risk of Rain is back and better than ever!

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Bistro Blitz</strong></h2>Step into the chaotic and hilarious world of "Bistro Blitz," where you and a partner embark on a culinary adventure like no other. Team up to run a bustling restaurant, with one player assuming the role of the visionary chef and the other as the mischievous waiter.<br/><br/>Here's the twist: the waiter holds the secret desires of each customer close to their apron, while the chef wields the power to turn those cravings into delectable dishes. Coordination and communication are the keys to success, but who says you can't spice things up a bit? Delight in the pandemonium of intentionally mixing up orders and serving up culinary chaos, all while trying to keep the restaurant's reputation intact. "Bistro Blitz" is not just a game – it's a recipe for laughter, collaboration, and maybe a dash of delightful mayhem. <strong>This is a multiplayer only game.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Gameplay Overview</strong></h2>You and a friend are running a restaurant together. One player will be the chef and the other will be the waiter. The waiter is the only one that can take and see customer's orders, and the chef is the only one that can make the dishes. You need to work together and communicate in order to make the meals that the customers want.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Create your own custom meals</li><li>Take orders from customers</li><li>Earn money by fulfilling orders</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Credits</strong></h2>Programming, Testing, &amp; World Design - Ethan Barlevy<br/>Main Menu theme - Levy Barlevy<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>This is a student project.</strong></h2>Because of this, there is no guarantee of updates after release.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><strong>Why are the minimum requirements so high?</strong><br/>I am only able to test on my computer so I only checked on that system. The game will probably run with lower specs but I can not confirm that it will work.<br/><br/><strong>What do I do if the interactions break?</strong><br/>This can usually be fixed if you walk away then back towards whatever you were trying to interact with. If that still doesn't work, you need to throw away whatever you are holding and try again.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/Support.gif?t=1702659747"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/plot_eng.png?t=1702659747"><br/>Black hordes are in a hurry to desecrate the remnants of Whitehills and turn everything into a gloomy land, where there will be no place for bright colors and other values.<br/>Grandmaster Bor does not agree with this, who calls on the help of the inhabitants of Whitehills epic heroes of singles. These heroes have the stamina of elephants, one-hit death, regenerate like vampires, and take on the form of defeated foes as mimics.<br/>Your role is to guide such heroes in battles and choose the best strategy for defeating the forces of the Horde.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/features_eng.png?t=1702659747"><br/>- Turn-based tactical battles where hordes of enemies each time use a variety of battle formations. A curious mixture of the use of simplified chess rules tactics and various skill bonuses available only to heroes.<br/><br/>- there will be a lot to do. You will either have to go on a decisive Assault, or retreat in search of a safe haven in order to save the accumulated resources and the life of the hero. Either manage the Citadel, or choose the direction of the main attack on the campaign map. Gather resources from subordinate domains or solve a variety of puzzles that have multiple solutions.<br/><br/>- when attacking enemy territories, try to complete the tasks that are constantly given by the Administration of the Whitehills Citadel. As a reward, you will receive Glory Points that can be used at the Merchant. The Merchant will help you recruit new chess clans. The chess clan selected as a priority will give the heroes an additional special advantage in battles.<br/><br/>- a large arsenal of various skill bonuses available only to epic heroes makes them even stronger. The effectiveness of skills depends very much on the time and place of their application. A well-applied bonus can come in handy in almost hopeless situations or radically change the course of a battle. Experience and skill matter more than blind chance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/Respect.gif?t=1702659747"><br/><br/>- do not forget to develop the Citadel, the capital of Whitehills, in which more then ten most important buildings are located. All of them can be improved many times over. Each improvement has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the heroes in battles and the ease of passing the Campaign. Until a complete victory in the campaign, all buildings cannot be improved. It is up to the Ruler to decide which upgrades to the Citadel's buildings best fit his victory strategy.<br/><br/>- even at night, the capital of Whitehills cannot be completely safe. Constant Sabotage will be a problem until victory. To develop Counterintelligence and put up new barriers for enemy saboteurs to enter the city or solve puzzles where there is no room for error, and then, with the help of the Inquisition, take away valuable resources from captured enemies, again, the Ruler decides.<br/><br/>- as the heroes progress, more commoners will decide to become Copycats. Imitators seek out the remnants of enemy units in the liberated territories and destroy the leaders so that the rest of the enemies scatter in a panic.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/PsyhoAttack.gif?t=1702659747"><br/><br/>- the style of passing the Campaign depends on the preferences of the Ruler. You can rush into the most dangerous fights with little preparation, but victory will be a great test of luck, intelligence, and sometimes the reaction of the Ruler and will require a lot of effort. And you can start with simple tasks to accumulate resources, develop the Citadel and call on the help of the Copycats, who will make a significant contribution to the victory over the Horde.<br/><br/>- control over key areas of the global map - clan domains, among which are: Academies, Castles and Obelisks, provides a periodic influx of various resources. All resources are very important for the economy of Whitehills. Spend the resources you earn after receiving and you will become an even greater threat to the Horde.<br/><br/>- destroy the most powerful figures of the Black Horde - queens, who are always armed with smashing two-handed swords and get Revelations. With the help of the received Revelations and archivist Agnotius, you will be able to restore the frescoes in the Temple of the Grandmaster and learn the background of this conflict and possibly other secrets.<br/><br/>- The more successful you become in the fight against the Black Horde, the more dangerous surprises you will meet on your way. Various game situations will constantly alternate making each battle special. There are already nine special game situations in the game: Ambushes, Spellcasters, Psychic Attacks, Warlocks, Acid Rains, Specials, Caches, Obstacles and Hostages.<br/><br/>- Numerous advisors will guide you through the story and help you understand the details of the war for Belogorye. Support and help in difficult times. Each passage of the Campaign will develop somewhat differently.<br/><br/>- pleasant melodies of Whitehills from glorious minstrels will help you immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the world of the Battle of Grandmasters even better.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/dev_eng.png?t=1702659747"><br/>In the process of working on the game, We aimed to create a game "for more than one evening", which will give players a varied and enjoyable gaming experience. New mechanics are revealed gradually as you progress through the main Campaign. We have provided several different ways to learn including a full-fledged educational campaign, Bonusopedia, the storyteller Agnotius and others.<br/>We hope you enjoy playing this small but deep game.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2115530/extras/map.gif?t=1702659747"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

This one announces her arrival - several years after her disappearance. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946920/extras/2v.jpg?t=1702659672"><br/><br/>The protagonist, suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia, will have to make a difficult decision – whether to stay at home without medication and uncover the dark secret of his neighbor? Or should he buy the medicine and go to meet his missing sister, who, for the first time in ten years, has given a sign of life?<br/><br/>Among all the crazy theories that the main character is living with, this one seems to be the most true. Could the neighbor who haunts Patrick's dreams be hiding a dark secret? Who is she really, and why can't he get her out of his head? Does she even exist, and do we really want to know the answer to that question?<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946920/extras/3v.jpg?t=1702659672"><h2 class="bb_tag">SETTING: </h2><br/>The Paranoid action was set in the late 80s, which translates into both gameplay possibilities and immersion from communing in realistic locations, full of frightening, hostile creatures.<br/>Be a witness to the brutal scenes of murder and unravel the truth about your traumatic past and future.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946920/extras/4v.jpg?t=1702659672"><h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES: </h2><br/>● Two narrative paths<br/>● Dynamic, intense, and brutal combat<br/>● Executions by weapons and environment<br/>● Melee weapons and guns<br/>● Puzzles<br/>● Balancing between paranoia and reality<br/>● Terrifying enemies<br/>● A multi-threaded storyline that combines psychological horror with action and survival<br/>● Realistic visuals<br/>● Disturbing atmosphere mixing psychosis and surrealism<br/><br/>Join our Discord!<br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2FNhnNxDEr63" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://discord.com/invite/NhnNxDEr63</a><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946920/extras/ad1.png?t=1702659672"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							“The core, a compound found in all Slime, has always been something mystical and mysterious. The strange element could be synthesized by users, which allowed them to reason and manifest a unique power. Due to its inestimable value, an evil being began to extract it from the body of inhabitants of a Slime village, transforming its victims into slaves who had no capacity for logical reasoning and only followed the orders of their new master. While the remaining inhabitants of the village escaped, the terrible being commanded his new troops to hunt them down and remove their cores. This event marked the beginning of the conflict between the coreless Slimes and the Resistance, a group of people fleeing the attacks, known as the Slime Wars.”<br>
<br>
Slime Wars is a cooperative multiplayer game that combines elements of the Top Down Shooter and Party-Games genre. The game recreates an arena capable of supporting up to 4 players simultaneously, in which players must face enemies in frenetic combat.<br>

Customize your character the way you want and defend your territory against threats in Slime Wars.<br>

But… if you are the right character in the right place, you have power over your friends you know you crave. Enjoy it while you can, because nothing lasts forever and revenge is a two-way street.<br>
<br>
Play locally with your friends, or over Steam's Remote Play Together system if you can't meet up in person. Life is chaotic enough on its own without That Damn Goat!<br/>

I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many letters and stamps as they could inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ hidden objects, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class="bb_tag">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.						</div></div>]]></description>
