<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Works beautifully on Steam Deck!</h2><i>We're still waiting for Valve to officially verify A Highland Song for Steam Deck, but we've designed it from the ground up to work perfectly there. So if that's your preferred platform, you're in for a treat!</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Moira McKinnon is running away.</h2>To reach the sea, Moira must first cross the Scottish Highlands—a wilderness of paths, peaks, shortcuts, dangers, and song.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/waterfall-jump.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Platforming</h2>Climb peaks to orient yourself and plan your next steps. Spelunk caves, scale cliffs, jump from rock to rock and slide down scree slopes as you make your way forward.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/survival.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survival</h2>Wind, rain and cold are your enemies. Moira is no superhero, and the Highlands are not to be underestimated. Shelter to survive.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/ascend-peak-shorter.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Navigation</h2>Collect and position 100 map fragments to discover faster routes. The hills are crisscrossed with paths: some well-trodden, others hidden away.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/narrative.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Narrative</h2>Learn the stories and the secrets of the hills, which are filled with lost things, echoes, and memories.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/music-run-sunrise.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Rhythm runs</h2>Skip and jump through the valleys to the incredible music of TALISK and Fourth Moon. The landscape itself forms itself around the shape of the music.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/branching-paths.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">Replay</h2>Get ready to make the journey more than once, because a single trip isn't nearly enough to discover the Highlands' deepest secrets.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/moira-and-deer.png?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Story</h2>Moira McKinnon has never seen the sea. <br/><br/>For fifteen years she’s lived with her mum in a small house on the edge of the Scottish Highlands—then one day she receives a letter from her Uncle Hamish urging her to come to the coast. If she can reach his lighthouse in time, a wonderful surprise will be waiting...<br/> <br/>And so, Moira runs away.<br/><br/>The hills are full of secrets and stories, but what you find will depend on where you go. The narrative is not branching but weaving; a mesh of history, mythology and family secrets. What truths will you discover? <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/zoom-to-lighthouse.gif?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The World</h2>In the Highlands, every peak has a story to tell and every valley echoes with song. Giants sleep, ghosts sing, crows carry messages, and eagles lift the dead. <br/><br/>But the Highlands’ crags are unforgiving and its summits are cold—Moira’s trek will not be easy. <br/><br/>Can you help her find a way across this winding wilderness in time?<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1240060/extras/talisk.jpg?t=1701791974"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Music of the Highlands</h2>A Highland Song’s soundtrack is composed by Laurence Chapman alongside two multi-award-winning giants of the Scottish folk scene, TALISK and Fourth Moon. Royalty of the festival circuit, these two bands combine virtuosic instrumental playing with fast, inventive rhythms, to produce new tunes in traditional styles played with beauty, energy and swagger.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Blood West</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Deflect, empower, manage and solve each map using your creative and strategic mind.</i><br/><br/><br/>Anx Defense is a mind-bending twist on the Tower Defense genre.<br/>Place various buildings on the path of your projectiles to create your ultimate defense!<br/>Everything comes at a price though and you will need to manage your available gold, space and Mana wisely.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Header_Deflect.png?t=1701879974"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Mirrors_2_NN.gif?t=1701879974"><br/><i>Mirrors make the projectiles do a 90° turn and they can be hit from both sides.</i><br/><br/>This unique mechanic offers a lot of creativity when it comes to solving the map's puzzle.<br/>As the game progresses this will become more and more difficult, as you'll have to keep these things in mind:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Avoid obstacles<br/></li><li> Cover every monster path<br/></li><li> Reach each path in time<br/></li><li> Projectile should be strong enough while crossing a path</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Header_Empower.png?t=1701879974"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Gates_2.gif?t=1701879974"><br/><i>A projectile passing through 3 Damage Enhancer and then 3 Speed Enhancer.</i><br/><br/>Use various Gates to empower your shots!<br/>Enhance damage, speed, piercing or infuse Mana to your projectiles by placing the corresponding building on their way.<br/>You'll also need to build some farm to boost your economy, otherwise you won't be able to make it until the end.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Header_InfuseMana.png?t=1701879974"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2500450/extras/Mana_1.gif?t=1701879974"><br/><i>Projectile passing through a Blue Mana Infuser, a Yellow Mana Infuser and a Damage Enhancer. (with Mana Overlay activated)</i><br/><br/>Gates will need Mana to activate. Manas are infused to projectiles by passing through Mana Infusers (special buildings).<br/>There are two types of Mana -- Blue and Yellow -- and later on in the game, some Gates will have Mana Conditions. This means that in order to activate, the Mana Levels will need to satisfy some special conditions (for instance, holding more Blue Mana than Yellow Mana).<br/><br/>This mechanic leads to an intricate puzzle of Mana management.<br/>Mana Conditions also change with each level, meaning the Mana management puzzle needs to be re-solved by the player each time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Campaign &amp; High Scores</h2>The campaign features a list of levels, each with its own map, building restrictions and Mana Conditions. <br/>Each level also comes with up to 3 challenging High Score goals to reach!						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2318670/extras/symbol_logo.png?t=1701845559"><br/><br/>"Demons and undeads roam the land they say..." <br/>Imagine yourself being unwillingly caught in the fight between your world and the evil god Nemurtviya. The evil god has been trying to enter the world once more, and this time, he intends to stay and rule a desolate world forever. Forces of good have spent a long time keeping him away but have forgotten the weapons and alliances that stopped him hundreds of years ago. In this situation, you hear rumors in the inns that demons and undeads roam the land. Evil cults are popping up everywhere. And you need to take your blacksmithing supplies to Fallegthorp as usual. To get there you cross the Angrbotha mountains as usual. This is where the adventure begins.<br/><br/><strong>Angrbotha Mountains</strong>, an adventure RPG game that immerses you in a dark story and cinematic experience. It is a short cinematic, story-driven adventure RPG game. <strong>Regard it as a short solo RPG session with a game master</strong>. Levelling up, meet wandering creatures, putting the story together, making choices, exploring and finding items are important parts to put the events to rest. Sneak up on enemies and make kills in one hit if successful, so called Assasination mode.<br/><br/>In Angrbotha Mountains you will take on the role of a hero on a quest to uncover the truth about the past and stop the terrifying from happening. The game is short but packs an intense punch with its storyline and cinematic elements.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2318670/extras/banner2.png?t=1701845559"> </img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"Hey, Man! - Born in the Electric" is a fun 2D platform puzzle game in which a main character born by electricity in a city ventures to find what he sees. The game will provide users with a new experience with interesting stories and unique gameplay.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
1972 in a high street in New York,<br>
<br>
Steve, who collapsed in an unknown electric shock accident, soon came to his senses. Then, his body transformed into a glowing line and black.<br>
<br/>
Surprised by the strange change, Steve cannot understand what happened. Like the main character in the movie...<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, New York was transformed into a dark city where electricity was cut off. People wander in panic, and all of a sudden, a company called "Porco Electric" starts supplying electricity extensively.<br/>
<br/>
The company's founder, "Rino Porco," was known for his insistence on his own style. Those suffering from the absence of electricity are becoming increasingly dependent on electricity from the 'Porco Electric'.<br/>
<br/>
As Steve adapts to his new ability, he realizes that he can quickly pass wherever electricity flows.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day, Steve hears a rumor that Porco Electric could be behind all this chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"I have to find my true self!" Steve decides. And his adventure begins at the door of Porco Electric.<br/>
<br/>
Now, are you ready to join Steve on his journey to unravel his secrets?<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Our main character is born from electricity, and has the ability to pass wherever it flows.<br/>
<br/>
The game is made up of many levels, each of which is composed of various stages with unique puzzles and obstacles. Users must use their electricity-based superpowers as the main characters in these stages to solve puzzles, press buttons or operate switches to escape the room.<br/>
<br/>
The fun of games is to use electricity and use various tools. You can use laser beams to carve out new paths, or you can move through the socket where you can't go. In addition, the story of the main character and the secrets of the city will be revealed as the game proceeds to eliminate or avoid the enemy who protects the room with each key.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
