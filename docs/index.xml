<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Stargate: Timekeepers is a tactical game in which you lead a team of specialists through a story-driven campaign featuring an original narrative set in the Stargate SG-1 universe. Sneak a newly formed team behind enemy lines, use your characters’ unique skills, craft the perfect plan and defeat the Goa’uld threat.<br/><br/>The game will launch in two parts, Season 1 Part 1 on January 23rd and Season 1 Part 2 later in 2024. Players will purchase the whole of Season 1 for $29.99 but will only get to play Part 1 for now.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1523650/extras/sgvidgif3-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1706027134"><h2 class="bb_tag">DIVE INTO THE STARGATE SG-1 UNIVERSE</h2><br/>Stargate: Timekeepers departs from the end of season 7 of the Stargate SG-1 main plot to create an original story, unfolding over <strong>14 narrative-rich missions</strong>. Your adventure starts during the Battle of Antarctica, where Commander Eva McCain and her team are supporting the SG-1 against Anubis’s fleet.<br/><br/>Sometime later, Eva and her team of specialists are tasked with a new mission in the Stargate universe: help the Jaffa Resistance, prevent brutal rituals, strike against Moloc’s army, and seek an alliance with the Unas.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1523650/extras/sgvidgif1-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1706027134"><h2 class="bb_tag">LEAD A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS</h2><br/>Lead a team of specialists operating behind enemy lines. Use your characters’ unique skills to come up with perfectly synchronized plans to overcome Kull Warriors, Jaffa Generals, Moloc’s Officers and many new and original enemies.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1523650/extras/sgvidgif2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1706027134"><br/><br/>Natural leader and long-time soldier, <strong>Eva McCain</strong> is a master of automatic rifles and experienced at spotting weak points. Extremely agile and an expert sniper, <strong>Max Bolton</strong> can hide in a ghillie suit to find the perfect spot to take down enemies from long distances. <strong>Sam Watson</strong>, trained spy and technical officer, is an expert on alien gadgetry. <strong>Derreck Harper’s</strong> drones carry out some of the most difficult tasks, including healing allies and deactivating hostile electronic devices. The core team from Tau’ri makes friends along the way: <strong>A’ta</strong>, Jaffa rebel and sneaky thief who carries a Ma’tok staff for short-range combat; and <strong>Xugga</strong>, a powerful yet good-natured Unas veteran who joins your team along with a little friend.<br/><br/>Each individual has a set of unique abilities: play smart and combine them to silently eliminate your enemies in quick succession. Tactical Mode allows you to synchronize your characters’ actions perfectly.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1704530905"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Break into the world of Dizzy Fight - choose your character - a beautiful thief girl, or an ugly zombie, an astronaut, or an office worker, or perhaps a medieval knight - and fight against opponents in picturesque locations. <br>
<br>
Each of the characters has their own superpower, such as launching a tyrannosaurus or a sports car at an opponent. Also, each character has their own combo techniques, but in order to use them, you need to score a certain number of points in a fight.<br>
Currently, two game modes are available - against the PC and playing with a friend on the same PC (controller is required for local multiplayer).<br>
A dynamic setting, a fun atmosphere, and vivid emotions are what Dizzy Fight will give you.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Your job will be to exorcise and free them with the help of your team.<br/><br/>To exorcise a spirit, you first have to understand it. Search the place and find the clues left behind: diaries, newspaper cuts, unusual objects. Understand the person they was before their death, and gather as many items that are closely related to them as you can. Once you're ready, all you've got left to do is start the exorcism, pray you've understood everything correctly... and survive until the ghost is freed from this world.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1916310/extras/gif3s.gif?t=1706027371"><br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Unique and terrifying ghosts</strong>, with their own appearance and behaviours.

Play as the bodyguard that can break down doors, or as the medium that closely connects with the world of the dead.<br/></li><li>Procedural contracts that tell a new and fresh story to decipher with every mission.<br/></li><li>Level up and unlock multiple features, such as customizable difficulty and modifiers that will make every mission a new experience.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Shard Shuffle plunges you into a world that combines strategic skill and puzzle-solving. The goal is clear: strategically place pieces with various properties on the game board to destroy other elements and score points. Each piece has a certain number of life points and a distinct attack type. <br>
<br>
The game reaches its conclusion when the board can no longer accommodate new pieces. This is why methodical planning of your strategy is crucial to optimally eliminate pieces. <br>
<br>
However, piece destruction is only part of the equation to boost your high score. A combo system awards you additional points when you eliminate multiple pieces in one go. This allows you to obtain a highly explosive bomb, ideal for clearing a part of the board cluttered with pieces. <br>
<br>
The game also features a challenge system, adding a dose of excitement by presenting random challenges to earn more points and Shards. Once collected, these Shards unlock customization elements to enrich the gaming experience according to your preferences.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Field fortifications slow down the enemy's advance, and fighting dogs can frighten any enemy.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2756400/extras/Btn_lvl_aztec.png?t=1706011844"><br/>▪ Using the “Friend of the Indians” skill, you can recruit warlike natives to your squad. And the "Death Whistle" will allow you to resurrect skeletons before each battle.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Your job is to design and build game dungeons.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2402170/extras/gif115corphot.gif?t=1706007227"><br/><br/>The goal of each level is to design a dungeon with given tools so that it is beatable by players, but beating it takes them as much time as possible. The players are controlled by the perfect AI and are thus incredibly smart. They will find any shortcuts and loopholes in the dungeon design. This creates a unique dynamic where simple rules of player's movement result in mind-bending optimal dungeon layouts.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2402170/extras/gif2.gif?t=1706007227"><br/><br/><strong>Design Dungeons:</strong> Design and build game dungeons using a wide range of components, from floors and walls to rivers and swamps, enemies and teleports, traps and lasers, switches and sensors, and more. Twenty character classes are ready to beat the designed dungeons, each with unique movement and abilities.<br/><br/><strong>Perfect AI:</strong> Players who try to beat the dungeons are controlled by the perfect AI. They will find any shortcut or loophole in dungeon design. This makes optimizing dungeon layout very tricky and results in mind-bending designs.<br/><br/><strong>Hand-crafted puzzles:</strong> The game has more than 100 hand-crafted levels designed to produce tricky and complex optimal dungeon layouts from simple movement rules. Every level introduces a new and interesting combination of characters and obstacles that the player has to utilize to slow down the AI.<br/><br/><strong>Steam Workshop:</strong> Make your own levels in an easy-to-use level editor and share them via Steam Workshop. Or play top-rated levels from the Workshop.<br/><br/><strong>Accesibility:</strong> The game is colorblind and hearing impaired friendly; playable with mouse only, keyboard only, or gamepad; and does not require any time-sensitive or simultaneous inputs.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2402170/extras/companion.png?t=1706007227"><br/><br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2FSt5GrkeaqG" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2402170/extras/discord.png?t=1706007227"/></a> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Game Description</h2><br/><strong>"Avoid the mines, find all the treasures, and clear the stage!"</strong><br/><br/>The primary goal of traditional minesweeper is to locate all the mines on the stage.<br/>This involves distinguishing tiles with mines from those without, and game completion is achieved upon identifying all mine locations.<br/><br/>However, this game's objective is not to find mines.<br/>It's about avoiding mines to discover treasures, and the game is cleared when all treasures are found.<br/><br/>Even if you can discern which tiles are not empty, you cannot know whether they are treasure tiles or mine tiles.<br/><br/>Therefore, you can:<br/><br/>Use items to identify the nature of a tile, or<br/>Deduce from the surrounding numbers of mines and treasures, or<br/>Guess based on the current number of remaining mines and traps, or<br/>Just take a wild guess,<br/>to determine whether a tile is a treasure or a mine.<h2 class="bb_tag">A large-scale tomb raiding game mode with multiple stages forming one dungeon</h2><br/>In each stage, finding all treasures lets you acquire one piece of equipment.<br/>With each piece of equipment aiding in clearing stages, complete all stages to find the final treasure and clear the dungeon!<h2 class="bb_tag">A small-scale tomb raiding game mode focusing on clearing a single stage</h2><br/>This game mode involves solving a single stage using deduction alone.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controller Support</h2>No device other than a mouse is needed to play the game! In fact, using a controller other than a mouse for minesweeper feels awkward.<br/>(Gamepads are not supported.)						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">25 Missions</h2>Bomber 3 is not a flight simulator, it is an intensely realistic action-adventure recreating the sights, sounds, and split-second decisions of the young B-17 crews in the skies of Nazi Germany. Digitized sound, Animations, and a ten-man crew to talk you through the tough ones.<br/><br/><br/>And so it goes for twenty-five missions, Assuming, of course, you make it home from this one.<h2 class="bb_tag">You are in control</h2>Put yourself in the captain’s seat of a B-17 bomber, select your plane, select your crew and plot your path over war-torn Europe. Watch your elevation, watch your formation, and watch very carefully where you were over the target. This classic was a bestseller in the early 1990s.<h2 class="bb_tag">Deadly Games Classic Reborn</h2>Staying true to its original HyperCard heritage the core game will look and feel the same as Rene Vidmer's original, but the game will be delivered on an updated engine.						</div></div>]]></description>
