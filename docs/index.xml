<h2>About This Content</h2>
<i>“What was it like, back then? Just sheer joy, I’m told. Entire civilizations, rendered down for stimulants. Stars drained dry of their power, for a decade-long soiree. Oh, to have been alive and powerful in the last days of Empire - before She-Who-Thirsts…” </i><br/>- Gyrthineus Roche, former Archon of The Last Blade.<br/><br/>The <strong>Drukhari </strong>are an ancient race that fell into degeneracy and depravity, with their remnants only surviving in immense Webway cities. Though they have suppressed the psychic power of their Aeldari kin, they have replaced it with preternatural agility and rapacious cruelty. Their lighting raids from the Webway carry off wealth and captives to dark Commorragh where they suffer intensely throughout their short lives…<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Mechanics </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Power from Pain</strong>: As pain spreads across the battlefield, Drukhari are invigorated, thriving from the suffering. Their units gain additional bonuses depending on their experience level. <br/></li><li><strong>Corsair Outposts</strong>: The Drukhari rarely venture outside the webway, save to loot realspace resources. Their cities have a reduced growth rate, but it can be improved by controlling more outposts. <br/></li><li><strong>Raid from the Webway</strong>: The Drukhari strike swiftly from the webway, before vanishing with their plunder. Pay influence to create temporary portals and activate webway gates to move your raiding party across the map.<br/></li><li><strong>Raider Fortress</strong>: The Aeldari and Drukhari are forever battling over their access to the webway. Found cities on activated webway gates from which you can unleash your forces on Gladius Prime.<br/></li><li><strong>Soul Hunger</strong>: The souls harvested by the Drukhari are an invaluable resource used for their malevolent schemes. Destroying an enemy unit rewards you with influence that can be traded for economic boosts and combat effects. <br/></li><li><strong>Combat Drugs</strong>: The Drukhari’s foul Haemonculi render down some captives into powerful stimulants. Infantry units can pay with influence and hitpoints for temporary buffs that allow them to outperform their opponents. <br/></li><li><strong>Betrayal Culture</strong>: Drukhari are a vicious race, and only a huge display of riches will convince them to serve—as long as it also serves their interests. Drukhari cities have lower loyalty but gathering influence grants more loyalty. <br/></li><li><strong>Blade Artists</strong>: Blades have an omnipresent place in Drukhari culture, and each commorrite learns this from a young age. Drukhari units get bonus armour penetration in melee. <br/></li><li><strong>Raiders tactics</strong>: When attacking a new prey world, the Drukhari attack en masse from their specially designed vehicles to land troops as close as possible to the fighting. Drukhari transports are all assault transports and Drukhari infantry units can gain combat bonuses when disembarking.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Complete Units Roster </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Archon <br/></li><li>Cronos<br/></li><li>Haemonculus<br/></li><li>Hellions<br/></li><li>Incubi <br/></li><li>Kabalite Trueborn<br/></li><li>Kabalite Warriors<br/></li><li>Raider<br/></li><li>Ravager<br/></li><li>Razorwing Jetfighter<br/></li><li>Reavers<br/></li><li>Scourges<br/></li><li>Succubus<br/></li><li>Tantalus<br/></li><li>Venom<br/></li><li>Voidraven Bomber<br/></li><li>Webway Portal<br/></li><li>Wracks<br/></li><li>Wyches</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

You had been participating in a project that was supposed to benefit all humanity, but something went wrong. Through the gameplay, you will solve various physics-based puzzles using an energy-manipulating weapon, travel across space and time to explore surrealistic universes and find out the dark truth about this project and your connection to it.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_gameplay.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Solve various puzzles and trick enemies using physics interactions and your special tool - the Portable Energy Manipulator. <br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS PUZZLES &amp; INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gameplay_physics.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>Many objects in the game can be picked up, brought somewhere, or manipulated in other ways. Whether it's a computer terminal, a box you can carry, or a simple mug on a table. Explore various interactive environments to find clues and return to the riddle with a solution, which in some cases may be several. Nothing was made for you to solve, there's no cube dispenser or an obvious exit door at the end. It's all for you to figure out.<br/><br/><strong>PORTABLE ENERGY MANIPULATOR</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gif_photongun.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>The device you carry throughout the game can absorb different energy types from the environment and use them to perform various tasks.<br/><br/>Absorbing energy from a particular source will give the gun its’ properties. The heat energy from fire and radiators will melt glass, security cameras can be blinded by a beam of light, and for powering generators, you can take hazardous radiation from toxic puddles scattered across Delta Labs facilities. And of course, you will make an encounter with the quantum entanglement energy - the mysterious power capable of opening rifts between worlds. <br/><br/>Apart from solving environmental puzzles, your device can also be used against various creatures you'll meet in parallel dimensions. Most of the time you can't defeat your enemies; instead, you can use the Manipulator to outsmart or suspend them. Some enemies can be frozen in place using the force field energy, while others are sensitive to light and can be distracted by shooting a beam at it in the distance. You will require more advanced strategies and combining various energy types to pass them.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_story.png?t=1701271403"><br/>You find yourself in one of Delta Labs' off-world research facilities in an unknown dimension that looks more like a crashing-down laboratory. Your old friends Eugene and Alex try to connect with you shortly, and with their help, you start a journey through various dimensions. You will learn different physics interactions and meet unusual creatures on your way home. Along this, you have to unveil the mysteries of this project and your past. <br/><br/>Experience a non-linear story where your choice always matters. Can you get to the bottom of this, or just try to escape? Who to listen? Who to trust? Which side will you take? And will you finally “break the Principle”? That depends entirely on you.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_setting.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Make your way back to Earth through mysterious parallel dimensions littered with puzzles and secrets, uncover mysterious connections between the worlds you visit, and reveal the dark truth about Delta Labs and your involvement with them.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>“All is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come”, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape’s audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. “Time ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles… but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh—don’t come too close, you don’t want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?” The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. “Ah, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see… something… several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots – what could all this mean?”<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1701355158"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that <strong>your Dungeon is well-secured</strong> by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you <strong>turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise</strong>.<br/><br/>But what is that noise? <i>“Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!”</i> The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. <strong>The Dwarves have arrived</strong> to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart.<br/><br/>Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now <strong>bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-1_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Everything is better with Dwarves™:</strong> The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-2_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>It makes your Dungeon great again:</strong> Dungeons are up to four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-3_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Ripe for the taking:</strong> The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-4_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>New and shiny:</strong> An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-5_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Minions, everywhere:</strong> The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-6_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Many ways to tell the story:</strong> A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-7_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Change the world:</strong> Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/feature-8_EN.png?t=1701355158"><br/><strong>Work together, slay together:</strong> 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts.

As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction.

Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Tired of endless climbing? Congratulation you have a new option! This is a high difficulty 3D platform jumping game. The high demand for directional control coupled with minimal room for error makes for more challenging levels. Reaching the top is no easy task.Don't expect any edge climbing to give you any hope to survive, in this game, there are no such lucky ways. All you can do is move, jump, and sprint.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622540/extras/demo01.gif?t=1701398622"><br/>Sounds simple, right? Different from traditional platform jumping games, the control of the view plays a crucial role. The view is closely related to each of your operations and determines your moving direction, sprinting direction, and bouncing or propelling direction. I bet no one has ever thought of playing a platform jumping game like a FPS, relying on precise mouse movement. In addition to this, traditional platform jumping games require precision in timing jumps, avoiding moving obstacles, and taking advantage of sprint distance and direction in order to reach the next platform. These features are all emphasized in this game. Fully utilizing special surfaces for bouncing or propelling is your only way to reach the other side.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622540/extras/demo02.gif?t=1701398622"><br/>Do these blue and green bubbles remind you of another widely acclaimed game? That's right, feel the challenge in a 3D environment, an extension of a dimension. The level is full of various usable mechanisms, so don't rush to take your steps. Carefully observe and judge, taking advantage of these mechanisms, or even shortcuts, are essential for masters.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622540/extras/demo03.gif?t=1701398622"><br/>Don't worry, not that cruel. The game has checkpoints, but not saves. A little mistake will only cost a bit of time. What, you just want to show off having the shortest time? Well, never mind. Take it from me, a true champion who jumps to the top in one breath does not need the lifeboat of saves.<br/>As for the game graphics...what can I say...the trailer and screenshots are hanging right there above.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622540/extras/demo05.png?t=1701398622"><br/>Supports up to 8 players online（maybe more in the future）, will you regard others as competitors or partners? I believe everyone will have a different answer.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2622540/extras/multiplayer.png?t=1701398622"><br/>Enjoy!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"- Math, BFF, and Notes - 数学と親友とネタ帳" is a novel game in which the protagonist, Takuma Toomi, wrestles with his feelings for the older, married women in his life.<br>
A Bishojo Game released in 2017 under the "IncaRose" brand has been reworked for the "PandaShojo" platform for players around the world to enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
◆Introduction<br>
You'll be alright.<br>
She wraps me in her warm embrace, I feel the soft touch of her hair on my face.<br/>
<br/>
It was at that exact moment that I'd fallen in love.<br/>
Older women are what I needed.<br/>
There wasn't anything I could do to change how I felt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆Synopsis<br/>
Takuma Toomi of the Manzai club is well known for his energetic greetings.<br/>
Good morning Mrs. Shiho, you're as pretty as ever!<br/>
Shiho Iizuka lives next door and was married to a recently popular TV personality.<br/>
Though she usually just laughs his approaches off, Takuma had made a point of greeting her whenever they met.<br/>
In fact, he'd only entered the Manzai club in an effort to emulate Shiho's husband.<br/>
<br/>
Though Takuma only has eyes for older women, Shiho wasn't the only target of his affections.<br/>
He'd already been turned down by his math teacher, Aki Tokie.<br/>
And then there was his Manzai partner's mother, Sanae Miyauchi.<br/>
<br/>
What can Takuma do to get closer to the women he admires?<br/>
No matter who he chooses, it's going to be an uphill battle......!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
◆Characters<br/>
・Shiho Iizuka<br/>
You sure have grown up, Takuma. Is that a little muscle I'm starting to see on you now?<br/>
The housewife who lives next door. She's kind and pretty, but unfortunately she's already married.<br/>
She once protected Takuma from being bullied and he's spent every day since then trying to win her affections.<br/>
It seems that she's being abused by her husband, the recently famous TV personality, Gorongoro Dobazaki.<br/>
<br/>
・Sanae Miyauchi<br/>
I don't suppose he's here for me? Oh, who am I kidding?<br/>
The beautiful mother of Kouya, Takuma's best friend.<br/>
Of course, Takuma and Kouya got along well to begin with, but they probably wouldn't have become as close as they did if Takuma wasn't infatuated with Sanae.<br/>
She can play the Viola and also teaches a handicrafts class.<br/>
<br/>
・Aki Tokie<br/>
I need Takuma to come to school for supplementary math lessons......<br/>

Play with your favorite club in national and international cup and league matches.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to Assembly Line 2, the sequel to the factory-building and managing game.<br>
<br>
Assembly Line 2 combines elements from idle and tycoon games. Make the most money by using different types of machines to build an assembly line to craft resources and sell them. Unlock upgrades to make it more efficient and expand your factory.<br>
<br>
The goal is simple, build resources and sell them. Starting with a few machines and very basic resources, and using them with more advanced machines to craft and create more complex resources.<br>
<br>
Your factory will continue generating money even when you are offline. When you return to the game you will have piles of money waiting for you, but don't spend it all in one place!<br/>
<br/>
While Assembly Line 2 is an idle game, because you make the layout of your factory, it is up to you to optimize it to make the most money possible.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry if you get lost with all those machines to build, the game offers an information menu so you can see what each machine does at any time. It also offers information on each resource price, so you can make decisions on what to craft. You can also see stats on the amount you are producing.<br/>
<br/>
Features:<br/>
- 20+ different machines to build and optimize the best factory.<br/>
- Tons of upgrades to increase productivity.<br/>
- More than 50 different unique resources to craft.<br/>
- Multi-language support.<br/>
- Back up your progress.<br/>
- No internet required.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
