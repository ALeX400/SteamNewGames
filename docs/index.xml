							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich.

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

On your way home, you hear something in the backseat. Not expecting anything, only to see a pair of eyes looking at you. But he's not the only one. You are unable to exit the car so you need to text your family and friends, to help you in any way they can.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Immerse yourself in the darkness with Whispering Shadows, an immersive gaming experience that transcends traditional boundaries, exploring the deepest corners of the human mind.<br/><br/><strong>Explore Minimalist Settings, Breathe Oppressive Atmosphere</strong>:<br/>In this two-dimensional world, every step you take brings the protagonist closer to the thin line that separates reality from the nightmare. Minimalist decors, while evoking apparent simplicity, hide deep emotional nuances. Each visual element is carefully designed to amplify the emotional impact, creating a striking visual experience.<br/><br/><strong>A Unique Auditory Odyssey:<br/>Immerse yourself in this sensory experience where sound becomes your guide. The disturbing voices that resonate in your head are not just noises, but essential components of the narrative. Audio plays a crucial role, creating an immersive symphony of tormented thoughts and inner voices that guide your journey.<br/><br/><strong>Schizophrenic Narrative:<br/>Whispering Shadows offers a unique perspective by putting yourself in the shoes of a schizophrenic person. Experience the emotional ups and especially downs as you face the disturbing voices and tormented thoughts that emerge from the mind. Each breakthrough reveals a new aspect of the mental mess, offering a poignant glimpse into the complex reality of schizophrenia.<br/><br/><strong>Minimalist Gameplay, an Intimate Connection</strong>:<br/>Whispering Shadows offers minimalist gameplay to highlight the narrative and emotional aspect of the experience. Deceptively simple, your only means of interaction is a single key on your keyboard, used to advance. However, do not underestimate the power of this simplicity. Each step you take represents one more step in the protagonist’s psyche, creating an intimate connection between the player and the character.<br/><br/><strong>Evolution of the protagonist</strong>:<br/>As you progress through the various minimalist backgrounds, watch carefully the subtle changes that occur. The protagonist gradually loses color, reflecting the gradual loss of mental aspects. This visual transformation adds an emotional dimension to the gameplay, making every step significant.<br/><br/><strong>Emotional Challenges</strong>:<br/>Each scene offers unique emotional challenges, corresponding to the themes discussed, such as passion, friendship, family, love, mourning, and finally, the inevitable emptiness. These challenges manifest themselves through subtle events, visual changes, and audio variations, testing your understanding and empathy for the schizophrenic perspective.<br/><br/><strong>No Return Choice</strong>:<br/>Proceed with caution, because once you have passed a step, there is no turning back. This game mechanic reinforces the feeling of inexorability, parallel to the reality of schizophrenia, where choices can have lasting consequences.<br/><br/>Whispering Shadows offers a gameplay experience that goes beyond convention, encouraging reflection and empathy through simple but deep interactions. Each advance is an emotional exploration, an advance in the complex labyrinth of the mind. Will you dare to move forward, without ever looking back?</strong></strong> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong><u>Summary</u></strong><br/>-Pilot spaceships and lead an entire fleet.<br/>-Configure ship weapons, thrusters and modules.<br/>-Survive a hostile galaxy by fighting, mining, trading, crafting, exploring, doing missions and improving your fleet.<br/>-Colonize planets, moons and stations to expand your domain and increase your tax revenue.<br/>-Three different game modes:  campaign, custom and scenario.<br/>-Map editor included for creating your own mods and scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><u><strong>Game Modes</strong></u><br/>Cosmic Armada is an action-packed space combat and exploration game that takes you on a journey from refugee to galactic conqueror.<br/><br/>There are three different game modes: campaign, custom game, and scenario.  The game includes a map editor which allows you to create scenarios and mods.<br/><br/>In the campaign, you start out as a refugee who's home planet has just been conquered by the tyrannical Solar Empire.  You and your fellow refugees must struggle to survive, take back your homeworld and get revenge against the empire.  Each new campaign includes a procedurally generated galaxy that will be different each time you start a new game.<br/><br/>In custom game mode, you must conquer the capitals of all your archenemies.  At the beginning of the game, you select which factions you want to play with and who your archenemies are.  The game will create a procedurally generated galaxy for each new custom game.<br/><br/>In scenario mode, you can play any scenarios created in the map editor or downloaded from the workshop.<br/><br/><u><strong>Manage Your Fleet</strong></u><br/>One ship won't be enough to survive in a very dangerous galaxy.  You must build a fleet of ships in order to withstand the attacks from the Solar Empire, the Hex AI, the alien Vurgak Empire, and various criminal organizations.<br/><br/>As you earn money doing missions or selling the items you mine, craft or steal, you will be able to purchase ships at shipyards across the galaxy.  You can also add ships to your fleet by boarding and capturing enemy or derelict ships.<br/><br/>You control the lead ship of your fleet directly, and the rest of the ships in your fleet follow it.  Different fleet formations are available to control the overall behavior of your other ships.  If you wish to pilot a different ship in your fleet, you can easily switch to it in the fleet panel, and the rest of the fleet will follow that ship instead.<br/><br/><u><strong>Upgrade Your Ships</strong></u><br/>Each ship can be modified at mechanic shops across the galaxy.  Weapons, thrusters and modules can be added or removed at the mechanic shop.  The mechanic shops will also sell these items and repair your ships if they are damaged.  When ships are destroyed, they sometimes drop weapons, thrusters or modules that can be picked up.<br/><br/><u><strong>Build and Upgrade Colonies</strong></u><br/>You begin with one small colony that can't provide much, so upgrading your colony and founding new ones is essential.  Each colony can provide tax income to fund your fleet operations, a place to repair and refuel your fleet, a place to store your items, markets to trade, shipyards to buy ships, and more.  The more and bigger colonies you have, the larger fleet you can afford.  The crew on all your ships needs to be paid, so larger fleets will cost more and will require more income to support.<br/><br/>To upgrade your colonies, you can construct various buildings that provide different functions.  Each building will require resources to build.  These resources can be purchased from other factions or manufactured using factories, smelters and raw resources that can be mined from asteroids.<br/><br/><u><strong>Mining, Crafting and Trade</strong></u><br/>Your ship can be equipped with mining lasers to mine resources from asteroids.  These resources can be sold or used to manufacture more valuable items.  Crafting is done automatically by factories and smelters which can be built at any colony you own.  All you have to do is select the item to manufacture and make sure the required ingredients are in the colony inventory.  These items can be used to construct buildings or traded at markets across the galaxy.<br/><br/><u><strong>Piracy</strong></u><br/>Surviving the galaxy is challenging, and you may be forced to use nefarious means to get what you want.  You may have to hunt for bounties, board ships, steal ships, steal money or smuggle goods.  Cloaking devices and powerful weapons are essential for those willing to get involved in the underworld.<br/><br/><u><strong>Missions</strong></u><br/>The campaign includes a series of tutorial and story missions that must be completed in order to win the game and make it into the high score list.<br/><br/>In addition to story missions, each colony has its own HQ which gives out random missions the player can complete for money.  These non-story missions are available in the campaign, custom games and scenarios.<br/><br/>For scenarios, the scenario creators can create their own story mission series in the map editor.<br/><br/><u><strong>Map Editor and Modding</strong></u><br/>The built-in map editor allows players to create their own scenarios and mods.  A custom galaxy can be created which includes new stars, planets, moons, stations, missions, and more.  Mods allow players to modify ships, weapons, thrusters, modules, fleets and factions.  Each scenario can be combined with any number of mods.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							An arcade game styled after classic titles of the first generation of consoles. Gameplay set in the cybernetic sphere, accompanied by electronic music matching the game's visuals.<br>
You are the result of a project code-named O---O, an alter-ego, a mechanical expression of your soul particle. You travel through the corridors of digital reality in order to annihilate the enemy of the system.<br>
The main rule of the game is not to die. Each time the core comes into contact with an object, you are destroyed, which means you return to the last checkpoint. The number of lives for each location is limited.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>
