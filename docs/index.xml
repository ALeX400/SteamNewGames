<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming. Each R2G title is a tribute to a single hit game from the '90s: a reimagining of a single universal story for a brand-new audience, using modern means and innovative, often vastly simplified gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/pillars.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> was first envisioned as a new game mode inside the Book of Demons universe, but we soon realized that its design is huge and that it should be executed as a stand-alone spin-off game. If you want to learn more about Return 2 Games or support us in the development of the series, visit the <strong>Supporter Pack</strong> store page. On release, <strong>HELLCARD </strong>will be a part of it.<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/706770/Return_2_Games_Supporters_Pack/" id="dynamiclink_2" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/706770/Return_2_Games_Supporters_Pack/</a><br/><strong>Book of Demons</strong>, the first part in the series is already here, be sure to check it out as it includes a free demo. <br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/449960/Book_of_Demons/" id="dynamiclink_3" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/449960/Book_of_Demons/</a><br/>Also, be sure to check out <strong>Book of Aliens</strong>, the second book in the series and a tribute to MicroProse‚Äô UFO: Enemy Unknown that‚Äôs also in the works:<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1196230/Book_of_Aliens/" id="dynamiclink_4" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1196230/Book_of_Aliens/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Q.P.I.D. is the latest release from Digital Eclipse Arcade, a series of all-new games inspired by classic '80s arcade vibes.<br/><br/>Like everyone else on the internet, Q.P.I.D. loves cats. Unfortunately, the cats that the Quadrangular Programmable Inversion Device has been sworn to protect have gotten themselves into places they shouldn't be. With nerves of steel and a heart of gold, Q.P.I.D. is determined to rescue as many of them as possible, even if he has to bend the laws of physics to do it. Toggle gravity, blast enemies, avoid hazards, and collect cats before your battery runs out. Part platformer, part puzzler, Q.P.I.D. delivers a hero who's state of the heart.<h2 class="bb_tag">Instructions</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Flip gravity to move objects, enemies, and obstacles<br/></li><li>Rescue cats on each level<br/></li><li>Collect all hearts for a perfect score<br/></li><li>Keep Q.P.I.D. juiced with charging stations</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Hazards &amp; Helpers</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>LOLLIDROPS aren't tasty ‚Äî they're nasty.

They also devour hearts!<br/></li><li>BEAM UPS shoot deadly laser light straight out when they're activated ‚Äî but you can flip their switches when you flip the gravity.<br/></li><li>WUVLIES make their way the only way they know how: End over end. You can blast these flipping foes, but beware ‚Äî shortly after being incapacitated, they explode!<br/></li><li>BIG CRUSHERS do exactly what their name implies: They crush (on) you big time. Don't get trapped beneath them!<br/></li><li>HEARTIANS attack in swarms when disturbed and slow you down, so be ready to blast them all before they reach you.<br/></li><li>SPEED ROLLERS give you a turbo boost. Walk through a light-blue column and get ready for a rapid ride!<br/></li><li>BOUNCE PADS put a spring in your step, sending you skyward when shifting gravity might have some negative effects.<br/></li><li>TETHERS automatically collect nearby hearts.

(Arcane Renaissance) in the World of Vyen. Mayor Nelly of Utania Village has started decorating everything with Christmas lights and pretty stars. She had everyone in the village prepare delicious meals and treats for the holidays, and they planned on celebrating Christmas Eve together as a whole village. But one day, the biggest Christmas hater of them all, Frinch, the Goblin King, threatened Utania Village that he would ruin Christmas and destroy everything. We must protect the holidays at all costs! Thankfully, Mayor Nelly found Mercenaries willing to lend their aid in protecting Christmas and preserving the holiday spirit. Help Mayor Nelly and her friends by forming your Heroes of Christmas to fight King Frinch's army! <br/><br/>But wait, how are we sure that King Frinch is the only adversary to the holidays? What if a certain Lovecraftian lord is yearning to end the festivities? Or a jealous demoness with burning desires to destroy the Goddess' festive creation? Or a mere simpleton who's more than meets the eye, pulling the strings?

 Experiment using different time powers.<br>
<br>
Time powers are abilities that allow one to manipulate the flow of time, such as speeding it up, slowing it down, stopping it. Some examples of time powers are:<br>
<br/>
Time Manipulation: The ability to control time in general, such as creating time loops, altering the past or future, or changing the rate of time for oneself or others1.<br/>
Time Travel: The ability to move across different points in time, either physically or mentally1.<br/>
Time Stopping: The ability to halt the flow of time for a certain area or target, making everything appear frozen1.<br/>
Time Vision: The ability to perceive past or future events, or alternate timelines1.<br/>
Time Blast: The ability to unleash a powerful burst of temporal energy that can damage or affect the target‚Äôs time1.<br/>
There are many more types of time powers, and some of them can be very creative or complex. For example, some video games feature time powers that can create a time shield, a freeze zone, a time dash, or a time bomb2. Time powers can also be combined with other abilities, such as spatial manipulation, dimensional travel, or reality warping1.<br/>
<br/>
Time powers are often considered very powerful and dangerous, as they can alter the natural order of things and cause paradoxes or anomalies. Therefore, time powers usually have some limitations or drawbacks, such as requiring a lot of energy, concentration, or skill, or having negative side effects, such as aging, memory loss, or temporal instability1. Time powers may also be subject to certain rules or laws, such as causality, fate, or destiny1.<br/>
<br/>
Time powers are a popular theme in fiction, especially in science fiction and fantasy genres. Some famous examples of characters with time powers are Doctor Strange, The Flash, Hiro Nakamura, Max Caulfield, and Tracer1. Time powers can also be used as plot devices, such as in Back to the Future, The Terminator, Steins;Gate, and Avengers: Endgame.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
