<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

While this system entails some inherent risks, it has proven to be extremely efficient.<h2 class="bb_tag">Energizing and recycling bullets</h2>The <strong>Bullet Tower</strong> shoots basic bullets that don't carry much energy. It is, therefore, desirable to energize them in <strong>Energy Towers</strong> before they hit batteries. It is also useful to recycle bullets that do not hit any battery in the <strong>Eco Tower</strong>. This earns the company <strong>Eco Credits</strong> and keeps environmentalists at arm's length.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/charging.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Changing bullet direction</h2>Due to the complicated layouts of our factory floors, it is often necessary to change the bullet path to avoid an obstacle. This can be achieved by <strong>Bend Towers</strong> that change the bullet's direction by 90 degrees.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/bending.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Splitting bullets</h2>Building multiple <strong>Bullet Towers</strong> to increase the number of bullets in circulation can be quite expensive. So here's an alternative: <strong>Split Tower</strong> takes an already existing bullet on the input and splits it into three bullets with reduced energy.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/splitting.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Fusing bullets</h2>To create the most powerful bullets, it is necessary to utilize the <strong>Fuse Tower</strong> that fuses the energies of three incoming bullets into one. The combined bullet has very <strong>high energy</strong> and pierces through batteries instead of being destroyed. This way, only a fraction of the energy will be used for charging, and the rest will pierce through.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/fuse_and_pierce.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Routing bullets</h2>The <strong>Junction Tower</strong> is quite versatile and can be used in various situations. It can chain bullet streams, fuse them, and perform complex bullet-routing tasks. Furthermore, the routing direction can be switched when hit from the side with the lever.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/switching.gif?t=1708359897"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Suddenly one day found that I found that I would never see him again, I ignored all the signs that he was going to leave, ignored the information that life was passing. At this time, my mind just keeps circulating those most regrettable pictures. If we could go back in time, could we find this information and make up for these regrets?<br>
Each regret screen is a level, and you will experience the whole process from ignoring to losing. You will also experience the ability to travel back in time, and I hope you take advantage of this opportunity to make up for some small regrets.<br>

This game commemorates him in heaven.<br>
<br>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Overview</strong><br/>Following "Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm", "Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward" introduces a new parallel world with new characters and gameplay meticulously optimized for your enjoyment. This game preserves the classic 2D fighting game format and features high-quality pixel graphics and a simple gameplay style that anyone can pick up. <br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>Dec 25th, 1926. The imperial era name transitions to "Kobun” and seems to herald the dawn of a new period in history. <br/><br/>But behind the scenes, a Japanese nationalist revolutionary group has staged a coup d’etat with the goal of restoring "the divine nation of Japan." The revolutionaries acted swiftly, seizing control of the Prime Minister’s residence, the police department, major corporations, and newspapers. <br/><br/>Struggling to react, former government forces initiated a secret plan to eliminate key figures involved in the coup through an assassination program known as "Yatagarasu." This covert opeation was assigned to the "Iga Clan", a ninja clan that exists today as an intelligence agency and who are also known as "Government Dogs."<br/><br/><strong>New Characters</strong><br/>Ugui (VA: Shinobu Matsumoto)<br/>An elderly butler who serves the last descendant of the now-deposed Suitoku royal family. Wugui was retained by the former king, but his demeanor and skills are uncharacteristic of a butler and his background is shrouded in mystery. He intends to use the current unrest in Japan to manipulate the government and restore the royal family.<br/><i>"It's time to purge."</i><br/><br/>Ao Tienyi (VA: Yumiri Hanamori)<br/>The last living descendant of the Suitoku royal family. When the royal family was dethroned, she was spirited away by Wugui and lived in hiding. She has agreed to Wugui’s plan to use the current unrest in Japan to rebuild her former kingdom. Tienyi is naturally timid, but decided to take on the role of the "bright and cheerful princess" after being deeply moved by Kotaro's acting.<br/><i>"Have I become the lady you wish for?"</i><br/><br/>Sistan (VA: Hisako Kanemoto)<br/>Originally an automated doll designed to bring joy to people, Sistan was reprogrammed by a certain nation to become a secret operative. She was dispatched to Japan on a mission to locate a ‘Divine Drive’ said to be able to predict any event or grant wishes.<br/><i>"I will execute my orders... and eliminate all obstacles..."</i><br/><br/><strong>About This Game</strong><br/>"Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward" is an original 2D fighting game. Our goal was to provide easy-to-understand gameplay so many people can enjoy the fun of fighting games. We deliberately kept the gameplay simple and focused on building a strong base around the fundamentals of fighting games and enabling players to enjoy the fun, core aspects of fighting games.<br/><br/>・An Original 2D Fighting Game<br/>An original 2D fighting game designed in the pixel art style which has become less common over the years. We paid close attention to designing appealing character designs and animations that can only be expressed in old-school pixel art.<br/><br/>・Core "blocking" System<br/>Yatagarasu's core gameplay mechanic is the blocking / "BL" system, which centers on deflecting your opponent's attacks and counterattacking. This simple system makes it easy to understand and apply strategy in the game.<br/><br/>・Simple Game System<br/>For a modern fighting game, Yatagarasu is very straightforward. Our goal was to create a game that anyone can pick up and play but also offers deep gameplay.<br/><br/>・Commentary System<br/>In live settings, fighting games have an off-screen appeal that includes fun smack talk, cheering, and commentary to engage the audience. To recreate this lively off-screen excitement, we’ve integrated a commentary system into the game. This is a unique feature where real-time commentary and hype play out as matches develop. <br/><br/>・Network Battle Support<br/>For "Yatagarasu Enter the Eastward", we've implemented our own netcode from scratch. You can enjoy smooth online battles with minimal network lag. This game includes a variety of features such as ranked matches, lobby matches, playing while waiting, and spectating.
