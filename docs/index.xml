<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Content</h2>
							Gain access to the two upcoming major expansions for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader and save with the bundle price!<br>
<br>
1. Void Shadows<br>
(coming June 2024)<br>
<br>
The first major story expansion is all about the Rogue Trader's voidship, the life of its crew, and the threats lurking in its holds. Dive into a new epic story integrated into the main narrative, battle new enemies, and recruit a new companion — a death cult assassin. Explore new decks of your voidship, unlock new upgrade options, and master the mechanics of void combat. Meet new members of your crew on the bridge, such as the Astropath, the chirurgeon, and others.<br>
The events of this story will be reflected in the game's epilogue.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion offers 15 hours of gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Lex Imperialis<br/>
(coming December 2024)<br/>
<br/>
The second major story expansion sees the Lord Captain join forces with a new companion — a member of the Adeptus Arbites. As the past of House von Valancius begins to present itself in a new light, the Rogue Trader faces difficult decisions that may affect the future of the entire Koronus Expanse.<br/>
Over the course of this story, you will get a chance to learn more about the collection of the Imperial Tithe, otherwise known as the Grand Harvesting. Interfere with this fundamental process of the Imperium at your own peril. Discover new areas, game mechanics, and archetypes — and of course, encounter new horrors of the Immaterium.<br/>
<br/>
This expansion likewise offers 15 hours of gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Blood West</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header_alt_assets_1.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1702449188"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1851610/extras/rivertailgif1.gif?t=1702569292"><br/><br/><strong>River Tails: Stronger Together</strong> is a <strong>3D co-op adventure platformer</strong> with a colourful cartoon aesthetic. Teammates must work together to defeat end-of-level bosses and solve puzzles across a range of natural-world environments. <br/><br/>Play either as <strong>Furple</strong>, the curious and excitable purple kitten, or <strong>Finn</strong>, the independent fish with a bit of an attitude problem. You’ll embark upstream with these unexpected allies, towards the icy mountain where Furple’s family are in mortal danger. Can you save them in time? <br/><br/><strong>* River Tails: Stronger Together requires a controller in order to play. *</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Immerse yourself in visually stunning natural-world environments</h2><br/>In River Tails, you’ll embark on an epic and visually stunning journey across land and water. Explore the flora of uncharted rainforests, immerse yourself in the magical atmosphere of river caves, cross the treacherous swamp (if you can!). Only then will you get back to the icy mountain. On your way, you’ll encounter a wide range of local wildlife - but be sure to work out which are your friends and which are your enemies before it's too late! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1851610/extras/rivertailsgif2.gif?t=1702569292"><h2 class="bb_tag">Innovative and constantly evolving gameplay</h2><br/>Your journey will be filled with innovative and fun river-themed challenges. The further you travel, the more mechanics and puzzles you’ll face. To succeed, working with your partner is absolutely vital. You know that saying about teamwork making the dream work? It’s a little cliché, but totally true when playing River Tails.<h2 class="bb_tag">Nail-biting boss fights</h2><br/>They can be pretty scary, but having mastered the key co-op mechanics earlier in the game you will have all necessary skills to defeat these angry enemies. Just keep calm and work together. Bosses aren’t evil, but they do have some anger issues for which they should really seek professional help. They are very protective of their turf and aren’t best pleased when a lively kitten and a cool-guy fish get too close.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1851610/extras/rivertailsgif3.gif?t=1702569292"><h2 class="bb_tag">Play a co-op game in a challenging single-player mode!</h2><br/>River Tails is designed specifically for two players, but we didn't like the idea of a game that can only be played in one way. That's why we added the LoneWolf mode. We have added a special control mode that allows you to play as both characters using one controller. The coordination becomes between one part of your brain and the other!<br/>This single-player mode is a whole new kind of challenge.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1851610/extras/rivertailsgif4.gif?t=1702569292"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							In a world of religious fanaticism, F5 tornadoes and Ford Sierras you are Boulder, an undercover agent. Your assignment sees you infiltrate the <i>Bahnsen Knights</i>, a deadly, supercharged cult with an enigmatic leader. In this murky and dangerous world you must keep your wits about you and stay alive to unravel the mystery behind an old friend’s disappearance.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1933190/extras/WHO_ARE_THE_BK__1_.gif?t=1702568359"><br/><br/><strong>Who are the Bahnsen Knights?</strong><br/>The Bahnsen Knights are the fastest cult in the land. Powered by religious fanaticism and supercharged Sierras they follow their charismatic leader Toni as they unleash hell upon earth. What are their aims? Why are they performing ‘route exorcisms’ and babbling about 'miracles on the road'? And adding to the enigma: Why are they holding paranormal investigator Lou Hill captive in a trunk?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1933190/extras/ABOUT_THIS_GAME__1_.gif?t=1702568359"><br/><br/><strong>An enigmatic leader </strong><br/>The Bahnsen Knights’ highest authority, Toni, is an ex-car salesman preaching that Hell is not below but above us all.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114950/extras/banner_free_demo.png?t=1702562805"><h2 class="bb_tag">Play the free demo!</h2>If you like the demo, buy the full game and continue from your last save point!<h2 class="bb_tag">Learning should be an adventure</h2>Dialogue changes from English to Japanese as you learn and progress in this comedic RPG backed by professional Japanese voice acting.  <br/><br/><br/><strong>Learn Japanese RPG: Hiragana Forbidden Speech</strong> is aimed at <strong>anime fans</strong> with little to no Japanese ability, but any beginner may enjoy and benefit, even those who have studied Japanese and hiragana before. This is a full introductory Japanese course and adventure all in one. We've made the game we wanted to play when we were first learning Japanese.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114950/extras/dalon_meet.gif?t=1702562805"><h2 class="bb_tag">What will I learn?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>How to read, write, and pronounce hiragana<br/>Hiragana is a set of characters used to write Japanese words. <br/></li><li>Over 240 common Japanese words used in anime<br/></li><li>Enough grammar to understand basic Japanese sentences	</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">How will I learn?</h2><strong>Mild Immersion</strong><br/>Our frustration with other Japanese learning games is that while they teach hiragana and words, they rarely (if ever) use these learnings in actual conversations. Almost everything is out of context.  A random character, word, or sentence here or there. On the other hand, trying to learn Japanese by watching anime or reading manga is overwhelming (for a beginner).<br/><br/>We try to strike a balance between these two worlds.  This game strives for <strong>“Mild Immersion.”</strong>  We want to immerse you in Japanese as much as possible, but only beginner Japanese. We want you to feel confident that any Japanese that comes your way is something you’ve been taught and are capable of understanding at a basic level.<br/><br/><strong>Small Step Immersion</strong><br/>This game also strives for <strong>“Small Step Immersion.”</strong> We want to immerse you in Japanese one small step at a time. After learning a new hiragana, you will soon learn words spelled with that hiragana and immediately start seeing and hearing those words in dialogue and battle.  Slowly, but surely, your vocabulary and reading ability will grow as the game gently immerses you, more and more. <br/><br/>We believe context, immersion, and fun are key to effective learning. This game isn't just an RPG with Japanese flashcard-type battles. It is much more.<br/><br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FVkgM3zUgmw" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114950/extras/banner_join_our_discord.png?t=1702562805"/></a><h2 class="bb_tag">The Adaptive Dialogue System and how it helps you learn</h2><br/>The Adaptive Dialogue System helps you learn by doing. It determines whether to show dialogue in Japanese or English based on your current knowledge.  The more Japanese words and grammar you learn, the more dialogue will appear in Japanese!<br/><br/>For example, consider the following sentence: "doko iku?"  (Where are we going?)  <br/><br/>If you don't know one of the words "doko" (where) or "iku" (go, going), then this sentence will be shown in English.  This is to avoid frustrating you with content you haven't yet learned.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114950/extras/doko_iku_englih.png?t=1702562805"><br/><br/>However, if you know both words, it will be written in Japanese hiragana.<br/><br/>Pressing a button displays the "roumaji" of the sentence. Roumaji uses the English alphabet to describe Japanese sounds.  A second press displays the English translation.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114950/extras/doku_iku_anim.gif?t=1702562805"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Professional Japanese voice acting (Over 4000 lines of spoken dialogue)<br/></li><li>Teaches Japanese starting from zero<br/></li><li>Teaches all the most common hiragana<br/></li><li>Teaches over 240+ Japanese words commonly used in anime<br/></li><li>Teaches word usage and Japanese grammar (over 50 tutorials)<br/></li><li>Adaptive Dialogue System gets you reading Japanese fast without being overwhelmed<br/></li><li>Real-time battles and humorous dialogue make learning fast and fun<br/></li><li>Gradual Reveal Dialogue System lets you conveniently check your reading comprehension<br/></li><li>All Hiragana Mode lets advanced adventurers immerse themselves instantly in a deeper Japanese experience<br/></li><li>Battle drills can be disabled at any time<br/></li><li>Level up controls allow you to adjust the pace of your learning<br/></li><li>Disable automatic voice over to practice reading comprehension easily<br/></li><li>16-20 hours of gameplay</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tremendous replay value.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is an exciting medieval adventure in which the hero, The Caped Crusader, takes on the King's Guard in an effort to give back to the poor the gold coins the King has unfairly collected from poor tenants.   During the game,  one and then increasingly more members of the King's Guard are seen travelling through the medieval forest with the bags of gold they have collected from the poor tenants.  The Caped Crusader is watching their advances in the distance.  When the King's Guard stop to rest at their various campfires, they place a bag of gold on the ground beside the open fire.   This is when The Caped Crusader must advance and grab the bag of gold that is on the ground at the guard's feet.  But The Caped Crusader needs to be careful in his advance.  If he is seen by members of the King's Guard, the guards will attack and potentially seriously injure The Caped Crusader.  If The Caped Crusader is seriously injured he is forced to retreat  and recommence the game at another time.   What level The Caped Crusader can recommence depends upon how many bags of gold he has successfully collected before being seriously injured. The total number of bags of gold that The Caped Crusader was able to collect appears on the screen when The Caped Crusader is seriously injured.  The Caped Crusader's goal in each game is to take as many bags of gold as he can from the King's Guard so that they can be given back to the poor tenants.  To collect a bag of gold, The Caped Crusader merely needs to step over it.  Each time The Caped Crusader is successful in getting a bag of gold The Caped Crusader must return to his original campsite. The bag of gold will drop automatically when The Caped Crusader approaches his tent.  The Caped Crusader must drop his gold before going out into the woods again to get more gold.   This is how bags of gold are tallied.   The player can only advance to the next level when the necessary number of bags of gold have been collected by The Caped Crusader and been placed by him in the tent at the original campsite.<br>

Il s'agit d'une aventure médiévale passionnante dans laquelle le héros, le chevalier à  la cape, affronte la garde du roi dans le but de rendre aux pauvres les pièces d'or que le roi a injustement collectées auprès des locataires pauvres.   Au cours du jeu, on voit un, puis de plus en plus de membres de la garde du roi se déplacer dans la forêt avec les sacs d'or qu'ils ont collectés auprès des pauvres paysans.  Le chevalier observe leurs avancées au loin.  Lorsque les gardes du roi s'arrêtent pour se reposer à leurs différents feux de camp, ils déposent un sac d'or sur le sol, à côté du feu.   C'est à ce moment-là que le chevalier doit avancer et s'emparer du sac d'or qui se trouve par terre aux pieds des gardes.  Mais le chevalier doit être prudent dans son avancée.  S'il est vu par des membres de la garde du roi, les gardes l'attaqueront et risqueront de le blesser gravement.  Si le chevalier est gravement blessé, il est contraint de battre en retraite et de reprendre le jeu à un autre moment.   Le niveau auquel le chevalier peut reprendre le jeu dépend du nombre de sacs d'or qu'il a réussi à collecter avant d'être gravement blessé. Le nombre total de sacs d'or que le chevalier a pu collecter apparaît à l'écran lorsque qu'il est est gravement blessé.  L'objectif du chevalier dans chaque partie est de prendre le plus grand nombre de sacs d'or possible à la garde du roi afin de les rendre aux pauvres.  Pour récupérer un sac d'or, le chevalier n'a qu'à l'enjamber.  Chaque fois que le chevalier réussit à obtenir un sac d'or, il doit retourner à son campement d'origine. Le sac d'or tombera automatiquement lorsque le chevalier s'approchera de sa tente.  Le chevalier doit déposer son or avant de repartir dans les bois pour en récupérer d'autres. C'est ainsi que les sacs d'or sont comptabilisés.   Le joueur ne peut passer au niveau suivant que lorsque le nombre nécessaire de sacs d'or a été collecté par le chevalier et placé par lui dans la tente du campement d'origine.<br>

Deutch: Dies ist ein spannendes mittelalterliches Abenteuer, in dem der Held, der Kreuzritter mit Umhang, gegen die königliche Garde antritt, um den Armen die Goldmünzen zurückzugeben, die der König zu Unrecht von den armen Mietern einkassiert hat.   Im Laufe des Spiels sieht man erst ein und dann immer mehr Mitglieder der königlichen Garde mit den Säcken voller Gold, die sie von den armen Mietern eingesammelt haben, durch den mittelalterlichen Wald ziehen.  Der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang beobachtet ihr Vorankommen in der Ferne.  Wenn die königliche Garde an ihren verschiedenen Lagerfeuern rastet, legen sie einen Beutel mit Gold auf den Boden neben dem offenen Feuer.   In diesem Moment muss der Kreuzritter mit den Kapuzen vorrücken und sich den Beutel mit dem Gold schnappen, der vor den Füßen der Wache auf dem Boden liegt.  Aber der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang muss bei seinem Vormarsch vorsichtig sein.  Wenn er von Mitgliedern der königlichen Garde gesehen wird, greifen die Wachen an und verletzen den Kreuzritter mit Kapuze möglicherweise schwer.  Wenn der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze schwer verletzt wird, muss er sich zurückziehen und das Spiel zu einem anderen Zeitpunkt wieder aufnehmen.   Welches Level der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze neu beginnen kann, hängt davon ab, wie viele Goldsäcke er erfolgreich gesammelt hat, bevor er schwer verletzt wurde. Die Gesamtzahl der Goldsäcke, die der Caped Crusader sammeln konnte, wird auf dem Bildschirm angezeigt, wenn der Caped Crusader schwer verletzt ist.  Das Ziel des Kreuzritters ist es, in jedem Spiel so viele Goldsäcke wie möglich von der königlichen Garde zu erbeuten, damit sie an die armen Pächter zurückgegeben werden können.  Um einen Goldsack einzusammeln, muss der Caped Crusader nur über ihn steigen.  Jedes Mal, wenn der Kreuzritter mit dem Kapuzenpulli einen Sack Gold ergattert hat, muss er zu seinem ursprünglichen Lagerplatz zurückkehren. Der Goldsack wird automatisch fallen gelassen, wenn der Kreuzritter mit Kapuze sich seinem Zelt nähert.  Der Kreuzritter mit dem Umhang muss sein Gold fallen lassen, bevor er wieder in den Wald geht, um weiteres Gold zu holen.   Auf diese Weise werden die Goldsäcke gezählt.   Der Spieler kann erst dann in den nächsten Level aufsteigen, wenn er die erforderliche Anzahl von Goldsäcken gesammelt und in das Zelt am ursprünglichen Lagerplatz gelegt hat.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
