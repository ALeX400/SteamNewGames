In short, her knowledge must be handed down and <strong>YOU</strong> - a former adventurer whose career was cut short by mixture intolerance - <strong>will be the perfect candidate</strong>!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1883800/extras/MMM-CLIP-Mix-1.gif?t=1711560429"><br/><br/>Together with your goblin assistant, <strong>build automated production lines of alchemical workstations</strong> to provide potent mixtures to the local heroes, assisting them in their epic quests, and making you their favorite potion supplier. <strong>Explore</strong> diverse biomes and use your remaining adventuring abilities to <strong>gather and research exotic ingredients</strong>, leading to new mixing opportunities.

Set the course of history and experience different timelines in every playthrough as you write an epic story through your actions.  Lead your people through times of crisis and ages of discovery, face great challenges and opportunities, and build a civilization that prospers through the ages.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Guide_Your_Nation.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Dictate the course of history across ten ages, from the first cities to space travel.  Accomplish certain objectives and you can move time into a Variant Age - an alternate history with new rules, new technologies, and new units.  But beware Crisis Ages; following a path of chaos and disorder may plunge the world into a future filled with war, sickness or ignorance.  Then again, a wise ruler can always turn a crisis into an opportunity....  Choose the path with care, as the ages you pass through will have a lasting impact on your people and the world.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Choose_What_You.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Customize your nation by adopting unique Nations Spirits over the course of your game.  Will you be a nation of warriors or explorers?  Are your people lead by a Great Khan or a builder of monuments?  Are you known for defining  pop culture or for dominating global finance?  What parts of your culture will reverberate across history?<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Master_a_Deep.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Manage your economy with care and create a juggernaut of growth and construction.  Start with basic resources to gain food, wealth, and production.  As your advance, decide how to best convert these simple goods into more valuable products through research and improvements.  Specialize your regions, turning iron into weapons or tools, wood into paper or lumber, gold into coin or jewelry.  Ship surplus goods where they are needed, allowing the breadbasket of your empire to feed far-flung colonies or your industrial heartland to supply troops near your enemy.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Unlock_Technologies.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Pursue knowledge to research scientific and cultural advances, unlocking new units, buildings, and improvements to grow your cities or strengthen your armies.  Research Defense to train the first archers, Smelting to master iron production, or Guilds for making wine.  Variant and Crisis Ages feature unique alternatives, introducing everything from Cloud Estates in the Age of Aether to underwater cities in the Age of Utopia.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Achieve_Victory.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Achieve your ultimate success through a Victory Age.  Toward the end of the game (or earlier if your strategy is sound), dominance allows a nation to dictate the winning conditions.  The rest of the world must decide if they will struggle to achieve victory before the leader ... or oppose the leader's attempt.  Risk everything to take victory in the Renaissance or carefully plan for triumph in the modern era.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Millennia: Premium Edition includes the following content:</h2><br/><strong>Wolfpack Warband &amp; Eagle Archers cosmetics</strong><br/>Elevate the presence of your units in Millennia with the exclusive Wolfpack Warband and Eagle Archers clothings. Available instantly with the Premium Edition, this clothes pack unlocks unique wolf skin clothing for your Warband. Your Archer Unit receives eagle-inspired clothes, symbolizing their precision and keen sight.<br/><br/><strong>Millennia: Ancient Worlds</strong><br/>Take your first uncertain steps in a new era for humanity in Millennia: Ancient Worlds. Take control of your people before their first settlement, while they still wander as nomads.  Includes a new nomadic game start option, a new National Spirit, a new economic Good, and new Nation starting bonuses. <br/><br/><strong>Millennia: Atomic Ambitions</strong><br/>Unlock the mysteries of the atom and change the world forever in Millennia: Atomic Ambitions. The Premium edition adds ways to harness the power of the atom for the good of all humankind, but, there are also ways to turn the planet into a fallout-filled wasteland if you aren’t careful. Includes two new Ages, a new National Spirit, and nuclear options for the Strategic Warfare System.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fmillennia" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/616x152.png?t=1711472688"/></a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Store_Page_City_Growth_animation_Steam-Loop.gif?t=1711472688"><br/>Create your own nation in Millennia, a historical turn-based 4X game that challenges your strategic prowess across 10,000 years of history, from the dawn of humanity to our possible futures.  Set the course of history and experience different timelines in every playthrough as you write an epic story through your actions.  Lead your people through times of crisis and ages of discovery, face great challenges and opportunities, and build a civilization that prospers through the ages.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Guide_Your_Nation.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Dictate the course of history across ten ages, from the first cities to space travel.  Accomplish certain objectives and you can move time into a Variant Age - an alternate history with new rules, new technologies, and new units.  But beware Crisis Ages; following a path of chaos and disorder may plunge the world into a future filled with war, sickness or ignorance.  Then again, a wise ruler can always turn a crisis into an opportunity....  Choose the path with care, as the ages you pass through will have a lasting impact on your people and the world.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Choose_What_You.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Customize your nation by adopting unique Nations Spirits over the course of your game.  Will you be a nation of warriors or explorers?  Are your people lead by a Great Khan or a builder of monuments?  Are you known for defining  pop culture or for dominating global finance?  What parts of your culture will reverberate across history?<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Master_a_Deep.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Manage your economy with care and create a juggernaut of growth and construction.  Start with basic resources to gain food, wealth, and production.  As your advance, decide how to best convert these simple goods into more valuable products through research and improvements.  Specialize your regions, turning iron into weapons or tools, wood into paper or lumber, gold into coin or jewelry.  Ship surplus goods where they are needed, allowing the breadbasket of your empire to feed far-flung colonies or your industrial heartland to supply troops near your enemy.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Unlock_Technologies.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Pursue knowledge to research scientific and cultural advances, unlocking new units, buildings, and improvements to grow your cities or strengthen your armies.  Research Defense to train the first archers, Smelting to master iron production, or Guilds for making wine.  Variant and Crisis Ages feature unique alternatives, introducing everything from Cloud Estates in the Age of Aether to underwater cities in the Age of Utopia.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1268590/extras/Achieve_Victory.png?t=1711472688"><br/>Achieve your ultimate success through a Victory Age.  Toward the end of the game (or earlier if your strategy is sound), dominance allows a nation to dictate the winning conditions.  The rest of the world must decide if they will struggle to achieve victory before the leader ... or oppose the leader's attempt.  Risk everything to take victory in the Renaissance or carefully plan for triumph in the modern era.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Millennia: Premium Edition includes the following content:</h2><br/><strong>Wolfpack Warband &amp; Eagle Archers cosmetics</strong><br/>Elevate the presence of your units in Millennia with the exclusive Wolfpack Warband and Eagle Archers clothings. Available instantly with the Premium Edition, this clothes pack unlocks unique wolf skin clothing for your Warband. Your Archer Unit receives eagle-inspired clothes, symbolizing their precision and keen sight.<br/><br/><strong>Millennia: Ancient Worlds</strong><br/>Take your first uncertain steps in a new era for humanity in Millennia: Ancient Worlds. Take control of your people before their first settlement, while they still wander as nomads.  Includes a new nomadic game start option, a new National Spirit, a new economic Good, and new Nation starting bonuses. <br/><br/><strong>Millennia: Atomic Ambitions</strong><br/>Unlock the mysteries of the atom and change the world forever in Millennia: Atomic Ambitions. The Premium edition adds ways to harness the power of the atom for the good of all humankind, but, there are also ways to turn the planet into a fallout-filled wasteland if you aren’t careful. Includes two new Ages, a new National Spirit, and nuclear options for the Strategic Warfare System.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							We are "Bread On Board," a collective of independent game developers spread across four countries, united by our passion and meeting during a GameJam. <br/>Our game demo was born in the "BOOOM CHALLENGE", a GameJam by GCORES. With only 21 days, we created a game based on a given theme. After the competition, we even won the "Most Popular Game" award at an Online Game Trial Event.<br/>The full playthrough of our game will take about an hour. We hope to give you a short, but super heartwarming and loving adventure❤️.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2612680/extras/1.奇幻而治愈（英文）.png?t=1711531628"><br/>A rookie adventurer fresh on the scene and a former mercenary who was transferred into an adventurer due to injury.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>MIDNIGHT GHOST HUNT IS A <i>PETRIFYING</i> PROP HAUNT GAME TO PLAY WITH PALS! </strong><br/><br/>Lying in wait across a series of cursed locations, relentless spirits stalk the halls. Assigned to eliminate them are the Ghost Hunters, armed to the teeth with the ghoul-busting tech to banish them to another realm! Play both Ghost and Hunter in a chaotic 4v4 struggle between the living and the dead.<br/><br/><strong>TONGUE-IN-CHEEK HIDE-AND-SEEK</strong><br/>As a Ghost, conceal yourself inside seemingly harmless pieces of furniture to evade preying Hunters… but when their backs are turned, turn the environment against them with telekinetic bombardment. No chair, lamp, or grandfather clock is innocent in this hijinks-heavy frenzy.<br/><br/><strong>MIDNIGHT MAYHEM</strong><br/>The fun isn’t over yet...when the clock strikes twelve, the witching hour begins, and the Hunters become the Hunted. The tables turn and Ghosts become supercharged, giving Hunters a limited amount of time to survive their vengeful wrath.<br/><br/><strong>MURDEROUS 4v4 MULTIPLAYER</strong><br/>Play together and communicate with your team and ensure a triumphant victory, giving each other pointers on the paths enemies tend to tread. Create synergies with your team's abilities to outthink and outwit your opponents.<br/><br/><strong>HARNESS SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES</strong><br/>The restrictions of reality don’t apply to Ghosts, of course. Claim your supernatural powers, which include turning invisible, causing furniture to float, and conjuring a dangerous Ghostly miasma. Ghosts can even hide in plain sight by masquerading as a Hunter’s doppelgänger!<br/><br/>Ghostly Perks include dramatically increasing your weight, extending your possessing range, the ability to see nearby Hunters through walls, and much more. <br/><br/><strong>ARMED AND READY</strong><br/>Hunters must choose their weapons from a full range of hi-tech gadgets designed to cast out Ghosts from our plane of existence. Detect ghostly presences with the Spectrophone, Radar and Pathfinder, capture them with a Trap, and suck up their spectral remains with the Vacuum – or just blast them to smithereens with the Spectral Cannon, sledgehammers, harpoons, salt-spewing shotguns, and more.<br/><br/>Hunters can also select Perks to give them a special boost. Choose from an extra burst of speed, health-replenishing capabilities and a host of other powers to get ahead of the game.<br/><br/><strong>A BEVY OF BLOOD-CURDLING MAPS </strong><br/>Explore ten unsettling locations, including an abandoned theatre, eerie mansion and cursed carnival. Each map brings with it different tactical considerations and items to throw about… as well as plenty of opportunities to play tricks on the enemy.<br/><br/><strong>FRIGHTENING NEW FEATURES</strong> <br/>As it crept through Steam Early Access, Midnight Ghost Hunt picked up a gaggle of game-changing features, built on the feedback of its community of Ghosts and Hunters.<br/><br/>Dedicated servers and host migration support make setting up matches a breeze, while the Progression Tier and Challenge systems bring added competition to the hunt. Looking for less of the silly and more of the scary? The Experimental Darkness game mode lends a chill to the chaos. Not to mention crossplay, full controller support, and even the GhostMaster minigame to pass the time during the van ride to your next match!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The First Voyage is the very beginning of your Age of Water experience. Jump right into the intense naval combat, craft your first boats, explore the waterworld and get a good idea of what Age of Water is about. Don’t forget to wishlist the full game now!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_ship_anim.gif?t=1711025025"><br/><br/>Become a sea captain on a post-apocalyptic Earth completely covered in water and go on an adventure in a huge open world. Sail through storms, fight and trade, capture other people's boats or build your own, extract resources from the bottom of the ocean, reveal the secrets of the Age of Water world.<br/><br/><strong>Water post-apocalypse</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_1.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive.<br/><br/><strong>True open world</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_2.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base.<br/><br/><strong>Hundreds of unique ships</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_3.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. It’s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board.<br/><br/><strong>Fierce naval battles</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_4.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck.  You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements!<br/><br/><strong>Personal naval base</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_5.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources.<br/><br/><strong>Flexible balance between PvE and PvP</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_6.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers. In Age of Water, everyone decides for themself who they are today - a peaceful traveler or a bloodthirsty pirate.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity.  Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1310410/extras/GIF_VIPIntro_2.gif?t=1711546287"><h2 class="bb_tag">A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness</h2>Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret.

A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat.<h2 class="bb_tag">A Story That Challenges Reality</h2>Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment.

Face Memphis-X in the final level and put a stop to his assault as he crushes your soldiers in an attempt to get to your base.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2517850/extras/ToyVengeance.png?t=1710352808"><br/>You received new toys from your family. Isn't that lovely? Oh, it's for sure... <br/>Your old toys, though, aren't getting along as well. They are no longer cared for and have been forgotten. So what follows next? They're going to join together against you and assault your brand-new toys, so be prepared. But never worry! You're in luck since your brand-new toys are troops of green soldiers. They still require your aid though! Control, strengthen, and defeat the opposing forces! However, focus with care, the enemies you encounter might not be your old playthings!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2517850/extras/GIF_1.gif?t=1710352808"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2517850/extras/InteractiveTowerDefense.png?t=1710352808"><br/>Tower building alone won't be sufficient to repel incoming attackers. Build up your own troops in the best feasible positions, then unleash attacks into enemy territory. Never abandon your towers, and deploy your troops in accordance with the traits of the enemy. First, the attacking forces will attempt to get past your defenses. Build and improve towers to aid your army. By using unique abilities, you can support your troops and towers as well.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2517850/extras/GIF_2.gif?t=1710352808"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2517850/extras/EpicBattles.png?t=1710352808"><br/>Safeguard your base against waves of attackers.

Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body2_2.png?t=1710955211"><br/>In <i>Dune: Imperium</i>, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.<br/><br/>The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Footer.png?t=1710955211"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_customisation_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Customize and create your own trial patient.<br/>Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.<br/>Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. <br/>Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece!

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

Not only do you need to defeat every mechanical opponent in front of you, but you also need to strive for visually stunning performances to please event sponsors and viewers eagerly anticipating your cool moves. Their likes and dislikes will either aid or hinder you on the field.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/未标题-1_0006_Diverse-art-elements.png?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0008.gif?t=1710474278"><br/>Combining elements of "glitch art," "street art," "pop art," and other trendsetting styles creates a unique "cyber graffiti style" with a cutting-edge feel and visual impact.<br/> <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/未标题-1_0004_Modify_Inherit.png?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0011.gif?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0004.gif?t=1710474278"><br/>Through the participant's lounge modification pod, you can enhance and modify your cybernetic enhancements and weapons, creating a dangerous and diverse fighting style. From event organizers to sponsors, you will have access to a vast array of freely combinable and customizable drivers to equip your cybernetic enhancements with special abilities, making you unbeatable on the field. The relics of other eliminated contestants left on the field will also be a major asset, allowing you to break through with their unfulfilled beliefs.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/未标题-1_0002_Choose-wisely.png?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0006.gif?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0007.gif?t=1710474278"><br/>Breaking Show offers a range of combat styles to suit your preferences, whether you prefer hit-and-run tactics, head-on defense and counterattacks, or precise finesse. The Breakers in the lounge are a diverse group with unique fighting styles, providing a variety of experiences and event performances. Intelligent machines, poised to replace soldiers, agents, and bodyguards, are also preparing for the competition with flexible cooperation, adding to the already diverse lineup and ensuring that every contestant attempting to climb to the top will be successfully blocked.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/未标题-1_0000_Watch-out!.png?t=1710474278"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0010.gif?t=1710474278"><br/>As the venue for Breaking Show, the temporarily closed-off streets may appear normal, but be sure to watch every step you take, even on drainage grates or manhole covers - they could become deadly traps at any moment. Of course, this is only if you can keep your focus while taking down every mechanical opponent in front of you.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/分割线.png?t=1710474278"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0012.gif?t=1710474278"><br/>So, are you ready to make a name for yourself as a participant in the new season?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1800910/extras/header_game.jpg?t=1711553782"><br/>Prepare to dive headfirst into the quirky world of "Bot Patrol," where the daily grind takes on a whole new meaning! <br/>In this bustling asteroid station, life for bots is all about routine — wake up, punch in, push stuff around, and recharge. But one day, you notice something odd. There's a crack in the routine, something is off in all this monotony. And where did all those missing colleague bots vanish off to?<br/><br/>Embark on a truly riddled adventure through mind-bending puzzles spread across three different biomes.  Get ready for a roller coaster ride of old-school boulder dash mechanics with a large amount of extra spice. Maneuver through conveyor belt chaos, outsmart spinning guard bots with personalities bigger than their circuits, and dodge off laser barriers like a pro!<br/><br/>But beware! Every misstep could lead to disaster, from triggering contraptions gone haywire to pushing cargo drums just a tad too far. It's a race against mechanical mayhem as you uncover the secrets lurking in the station's walls. Who knew saving the day could be this much fun? There might even be freedom waiting at the end of the journey!<br/><br/>So grab your thinking cap and gear up for a quirky quest unlike any other. "Bot Patrol" is waiting for you to join the ranks of robot revolutionaries in the fight for freedom!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1800910/extras/header_play.jpg?t=1711553782"><br/>In traditional Sokoban fashion the player has to push all scattered cargo containers onto the right target spots to complete a level. Challenge comes from <i>only</i> being able to push, but not pull the barrels. This means every step has to be thought through to not end up in a scenario, where access to a container or its target is blocked.<br/><br/>Beyond the regular gameplay mechanics, Bot Patrol features an abundance of extended elements, that make achieving the goal a lot trickier. Conveyor belts, cranes, energy barriers and button triggers are added into the mix. Not to forget the evil control bots, that will perish the player upon contact.<br/><br/>And since playing the game is supposed to be a hard but fun puzzle challenge and not rage inducting repetition machine, Bot Patrol comes with a gracious infinite Undo, to take that one step back, that went to far. <br/>Or the one before. Or the one before that...<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1800910/extras/header_dev.jpg?t=1711553782"><br/>Bot Patrol has been developed by solo developer <i>a.mighty.dish</i> over the course of 3 years - as a hobby project next to a day job in AAA game development. <br/>It really started as a last big hobby project to finish before the birth of our first offspring. Natures deadlines are quite definite, so when the game was not really finished in time, development came to a halt between milk bottles and baby steps. <br/>Hot fast forward to two years later - with some small sabbatical time at hand - it seemed too much fun of a game to let it wither someone in the abandoned projects folder of ones hard drive and so Bot Patrol eventually saw the light of day!						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

The soundtrack is also to be mentioned: in contrast to the surreal world depicted, the music is more down-to-earth and straight to the point.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Embark on a voyage of environmental salvation and collection with <i>Clean the Sea!</i>—a compelling experience now on Steam.<br/><br/>In a world where the oceans are burdened by humanity's neglect, <i>Clean the Sea!</i> challenges you to pilot a lone vessel on a noble quest: cleanse the waters, rescue marine life, and turn the tide on pollution. As you navigate through tranquil yet troubled waters, your mission is not just to collect refuse but to catalyze change—one scoop of trash at a time.<br/><br/>Your quest will take you across the globe to some of the most iconic and afflicted waterways on the planet. Each location offers unique challenges and opportunities, from the icy embrace of the Antarctic to the historic waterways of Amsterdam. As you progress, you'll witness the tangible impact of your efforts, bringing life and color back to places once choked by waste.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Collect-trash.png?t=1711551087"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/collecttrash.gif?t=1711551087"><br/>Dive into "Clean the Sea!" where your main quest is to pick up trash. Every piece you collect—bottles, bags, you name it—helps clean up the ocean. Sell the trash, get cash, and watch as the sea transforms back to its natural beauty.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Hire-a-fleet.png?t=1711551087"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Worker.gif?t=1711551087"><br/>Start with a small skiff and aim high. Upgrades make a big difference: a faster ship speeds up your clean-up missions, and a larger picker increases how much trash you can collect. Upgrade from a skiff to a cruiser, making your clean-up efforts more effective and far-reaching.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Upgrade-your-ship.png?t=1711551087"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Upgrade_Vehicles.gif?t=1711551087"><br/>Boost your clean-up game by hiring a fleet of mini-ships. These vessels autonomously collect trash, multiplying your impact without extra effort from you. This fleet represents your commitment to efficiency, helping you tackle more of the ocean's pollution with every trip.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Save-the-animals.png?t=1711551087"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2232320/extras/Save_Animals.gif?t=1711551087"><br/>As the trash clears, marine life returns to the once-polluted waters. Witness the transformation as dolphins, turtles, and fish reappear, breathing life back into their habitats. This revival of ocean life is a beautiful testament to your hard work and dedication to the cause.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

You may know me as the creator of College Saga.<br/><br/>In June 2021, I fell and broke my neck while training my backflip. Immediately, I lost sensation and control below my chest and could hardly move my fingers. Such was spinal cord injury, a cruel and utterly humiliating condition with no cure as of today. To make things worse, I developed a life-threatening bedsore in the ICU in my lower back, which took 2 major surgeries to 'dig out' and fill with surrounding flesh, and months of daily treatments. <br/><br/>After a year of spitting into cough-assist machines and staring at hospital ceilings, I was discharged, having regained nearly no control of my body. I continue to deal with sensitivity to cold, persistent lower back pain, and the daily struggle of dizziness and low blood pressure that takes me up to 2 hours to gradually rise out of bed. Having minimal control with my core, I am always at risk of tipping sideways or forward unless I keep an arm on my wheelchair. With weak fingers, I can't click normal mouses or move around on my wheelchair. I am now 30% of my former self carrying a load of dead weight. I literally can't even steal candy from my own baby.<br/><br/>Being trapped in this body 24/7 has taken a significant toll on my mental health. I have never experienced such an overwhelming and profound sense of shame and loneliness. Knowing about my creative past, my doctor advised me to create once again as a means to prevent myself from spiraling into depression. A form of escapism, if you will. So here is what the doctor ordered: a fun, lighthearted visual novel inspired by 22 years of figure skating.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
