<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"<strong>Prime</strong>" is a board game inspired by chess and checkers. In the game, two opponents face off: the whites and the blacks. The game is played on a 64-square board, similar to that of chess.<br/><br/>The pieces are marked with a number, which is added each time to the captured piece's number or increased by 1 or 2 units when the piece is promoted (reaching the opposite side of the board).<br/><br/>Pieces with the number 1 are pawns and can move forward by only one square. Pieces with even numbers can move forward and sideways by only one square, while pieces with odd numbers can move forward and diagonally forward by only one square. Pieces with prime numbers starting from 5 can move in any direction (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal), provided the path is clear.<br/><br/>Pawns, even-numbered pieces, and odd-numbered pieces are eligible for promotion when they reach the opposite side of the board: pawns and even-numbered pieces increase their value by one unit, while odd-numbered pieces increase by 2. After promotion, the direction of the piece is reversed.<br/><br/>"Prime" pieces do not have a fixed direction as they can move in any direction (like the queen in chess). However, after capturing, if they become "even" or "odd," they also inherit the direction of the captured piece. In the event that a "Prime" captures another "Prime," the direction will be favorable to the side of the board closest to it.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has 8 pawns, 4 even-numbered pieces, 2 odd-numbered pieces, and 2 prime-numbered pieces. The player who captures all opponent pieces wins. The game can also end when both players possess only "Prime" pieces: in this case, the winner is determined by who has more pieces, and in case of a tie, the game is a draw or a tiebreaker.						</div></div>]]></description>

"Dark Gravity" is a fast-paced, low poly vertical shoot'em up game that features non-linear campaign mode with lots of enemies and bosses. Craft new weapons, upgrade your fighter and build an ultimate aerial war machine!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_02.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>After the fifth world war, there was peace in the world. For over a decade, the Grand Alliance has been leading humanity towards a better tomorrow by stifling all dangers in the bud. For some time, however, there is suspicion of a new threat that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>As a member of SAF forces, your mission is to take over the Shielton base, captured by unknown rebels. No one knows who they are and what they want. What's worse, even IMC forces couldn't drive them away from the base because of their advanced weaponry. Weaponry out of this world. But... are those rebels the main threat? Isn't there anything bigger behind all this? No time for questions! You must stop them at all costs!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_03.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Gameplay mechanics are very simple - destroy all enemies and try to avoid every bullet... well, at least those which can be avoided. Your special maneuver allows you to dodge normal projectiles. Even if you get hit, you will only lose one extra weapon! However, watch out for powerful bosses! They can thorn you into pieces with their ultimate unavoidable attacks!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_04.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>The story mode can be completed in a few various ways. Military operations are carried out on several fronts simultaneously. It's up to you which path you will choose. From battles high in the sky, through military bases, underground factories, collapsed mines and abandoned laboratories, to secret Arctic research facilities and the interiors of unknown civilization artifacts - you must go through all of this several times to accomplish all missions.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_05.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Every difficulty level is different. Improving your skills and fighter will help you out at facing hard and insane mode bosses, as they don't appear at easier levels. Enemy's layouts will change as well as their shooting patterns. At higher difficulties, you will also meet enemies that you have not met before.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_06.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Collecting drop parts and blueprints throughout the missions will allow you to unlock and craft new fighters, weapons, and upgrades. However, remember that only playing at the highest levels of difficulty will allow you to achieve a pinnacle of technology. Uncover the crafting tree and develop unique power-ups!						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
