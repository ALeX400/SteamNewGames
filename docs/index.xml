							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich.

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Tower Defense: Cats are towers, ghosts are enemies and humans are target. You must put the correct cat to destroy the ghosts.<br>
History: Few months ago, something strange began to happen. Civilians reported seeing strange figures wandering the streets, causing chaos and destruction in their wake. Soon it was discovered that they were ghosts who had appeared in the town and seemed to have no friendly intentions.<br>
As the days went by, the ghosts became more and more aggressive, and the humans began to feel helpless in their presence. But there was a group of beings who wouldn't give up so easily: the cats.<br>
The cats, known for their cunning and bravery, began patrolling the streets at night, searching for any signs of the ghosts. When they found one, they pounced on it without fear, clawing, biting and shooting until it disappeared.<br>
The humans couldn't believe what they were seeing. The cats, who normally kept their distance from them, were now protecting them from a supernatural threat.<br>
No one knows for sure why the cats decided to defend humans against the ghosts, but some speculate that they did it out of love for their home and their slaves.<br>
Since then, it's said that the cats are always vigilant, ready to protect their humans from any supernatural danger that may arise.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

The secluded protagonist  and their family are brutally murdered, but a man known as the  "Scavenger" clones the protagonist's body and resurrects him. In order  to seek revenge, the protagonist embarks on an adventure, piloting a  spaceship and traveling between various wondrous planets. He collect  the most important Yin and Yang crystals in the galaxy to strengthen his own body, all in order to slay the Emperor of the Holy Light  Empire, who massacred their entire family. Little do they know, they are actually getting entangled in a larger conspiracy.<h2 class="bb_tag">Multiple Attack Methods</h2><br/>The protagonist's unique physique allows him to merge Yin and Yang  energies to create a new golden energy. This golden energy can further  transform into various elements with different functions. By combining  these elements and energy projection methods, the protagonist can obtain different attack methods.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2619090/extras/m技能.jpg?t=1704256935"><h2 class="bb_tag">Balancing between multiple factions</h2><br/>In this galaxy, there are three major factions: local creatures, the  Holy Light Empire, and the Shadow Alliance.

When the golden energy exceeds the creature's own  energy, it will be controlled. Controlling a group of creatures to fight together can increase the protagonist's survival rate.<h2 class="bb_tag">Diverse Planets</h2><br/>The galaxy contains over 20 explorable planets, roughly divided into  the galaxy's edge, the Holy Light Empire-controlled area, the Shadow  Empire-controlled area, and the war zone.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In the eerie world of "Into The Unknown," players find themselves waking up in an ominous, dimly lit room with no recollection of how they got there. The only noticeable feature is a mysterious, foreboding maze that stands adjacent to the room, shrouded in an unsettling darkness. As the protagonist cautiously explores, the air thickens with an unspoken tension.<br>
<br>
The objective becomes clear: escape the sinister labyrinth. However, achieving this is no ordinary task. The labyrinth, a convoluted web of twisting passages and sinister corridors, hides a sinister secret. The only way out is guarded by an otherworldly monster, a grotesque and nightmarish entity that prowls the corridors, driven by an insatiable desire to capture those who dare to enter.<br>
<br>
To unlock the exit and evade the pursuing horror, players must search for twelve elusive keys scattered throughout the labyrinth's maze-like passages. The keys, strategically hidden in the nooks and crannies of the maze, become both a lifeline and a harbinger of dread.<br>
<br>
Each key has the power to unlock a concealed room within the maze. Inside this room, players will discover a statue. By successfully collecting all the statues, you will reclaim your freedom, provided the monster doesn't catch you.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Select using the cross cursor and direct your drone with pinpoint accuracy. But beware, each move is a test of skill and judgment – one wrong shot and you risk a catastrophic underwater explosion.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SCORE AND CHALLENGE</strong></h2><br/>Score points by successfully removing mines, with each mine's score value calculated using a dynamic formula. The stakes rise with each level, demanding greater precision and strategic foresight.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>URGENCY AND TENSION</strong></h2><br/>Keep an eye on the shot counter! If it reaches zero, you'll face the consequences of an unremoved mine: an underwater detonation and you lose a life. A warning bleep adds to the tension, signaling your last chance to act. As you advance, the game intensifies, offering fewer shots and increasing the challenge.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>RISK AND PENALTY</strong></h2><br/>Mistakes carry a heavy price. Failing to strike a mine or accidentally removing your aiming drone results in the loss of one of your four lives. Each firing decision will be the difference between victory and defeat.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GET STARTED</strong></h2><br/>Ready to embark on this underwater mission and become the ultimate mine hunter ?

The host is also going to play a top-down version of the game while everyone else is playing from a third person viewpoint. The host gains health from eating the other players, but also losses health when getting eaten by players. <br>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong><u>Excerpt from the back of the original Shipwrecked Box:</u></strong><br/><br/>	“BUCKY AND HIS FRIENDS NEED YOUR HELP!<br/>After a sudden crash during a routine fishing trip, Bucky ends up on a mysterious island, where his friends appear to be apprehended by a pack of wolves for disturbing the peace. Embark on a puzzle-based adventure, as Bucky wanders the vast island of Nulla Terra, helping his friends work off the damages, fix your boat, and get back home!”<br/><br/><strong><u>What is this?</u> </strong><br/><br/><i>Shipwrecked</i> (Or <i>Shipwrecked 64</i> as the internet has dubbed it) was an old game originating from the late 90’s, commissioned by the (at-the-time) beloved Broadside Animation Studio, developed by a relatively unknown game studio, Cogware Games. <br/><br/>The game had a very mysterious nature surrounding its launch, as it was only available from August 13th 1997, to August 17th, 1997, receiving little promotion from Cogware, and none from Broadside. This downloadable version of the game is the closest one can get to playing the original copy of the game. We at the SWRC (Shipwrecked Recovery Crew) were lucky enough to get our hands on an original cartridge, dump it, and convert a lot of the code to new software. With help from two of the original developers, we were able to make this game accessible to everyone. <br/><br/><strong><u>Disclaimer: </u></strong><br/><br/>	Shipwrecked 64, while portraying itself as an authentic product, is in fact a work of fiction. Some scenes in the game are graphic and violent in nature. Shipwrecked 64 is what people may refer to as an ARG, and will require out-of-the-box thinking, but also travelling outside of the game for answers. It can be very complex at times, and is intended as a community effort of sorts. Forum posts, or even playing in calls with others, taking notes, and other methods are the best way to proceed forward.<br/><br/><strong><u>Features:</u></strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Two Modes, a 2023 mode and 1997 mode. A fixed, safer version of the game, and the unstable and somewhat disturbing version that was pulled from store shelves. <br/></li><li>A game with multiple layers, endings, and many areas to explore.<br/></li><li>A strange, surreal, and dark story that jumps from our world to the game’s world. <br/></li><li>Exploration is a key aspect of cracking the case. Dig deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of Cogware Games. <br/></li><li>Controlled Decay, which will slowly break every level of the game depending on the actions of the player. </li></ul><br/><strong><u>Join us, and help us decipher what this game is trying to tell us. </u></strong> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Remember the days when games were simple to learn and really fun to play? Experience pure joy as you blow up your enemies in real-time with phasers and torpedoes. Watch those enemy ships blow to pieces and their bits fly across your screen. Check the view screen for the status of your Starbases, open up the Galaxy Map and see if enemies are nearby, spend some time jumping to different sectors and explore anomalies, or just jump to the unknown. Each time you jump to a new sector the game will auto save (provided there are no enemies in the sector) so you can re-play should something go wrong.<br>
<br>
Galaxy Trek lets you choose between seven levels of difficulty but the game play does not change.  The enemies will not be any stronger and your ship won’t be any weaker, so what you learn at lower levels you can continue to use at the higher levels. <br>
<br>
Galaxy Trek was designed to let you focus on the fun, without worrying about the details. As long as your hull remains intact, everything will function. Starbases are not necessary to obtain victory, but they are needed to repair your hull, so you might want to keep one around.  <br>
<br>
Galaxy Trek is the game for anyone who is looking for that fun and uncomplicated gaming experience. It’s a real-time strategy game, perfectly combined with a bit of Sci-Fi and a lot of exciting action. Featuring fun graphics, high-quality music, great sound effects, and easy-to-learn controls, it is a game that will keep you hooked for hours with no two games ever being the same.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Game mission:<br>
<br>
The main destination is the planet “Earth One”. After a failed laboratory experiment, most of the planet's humanity was overrun by spiders. What remains is a laboratory with our world-famous, genius Professor Dr. MS-SI.<br>
<br>
Initially, the mission objective is set by the command center in such a way that the professor must be rescued and freed at all costs using resources.<br>
It later turns out that our esteemed professor is possessed by spiders and is obviously starting to mutate and cannot be stopped. The mission objective is changed so that the professor must be eliminated. Now they come into play Commander!<br>
<br/>
1. Prevent the spiders from spreading further.<br/>
2. Fight back all the spiders.<br/>
3. Secure the lab.<br/>
4. Save the professor.<br/>
5. Destroy the professor.<br/>
<br/>
Commander, priority is to destroy the spiders and the professor.<br/>
<br/>
The game takes place in the year 2317. The global world government has tried to cover up the nuclear contamination and denies any form of alien spiders. Failure is not accepted. The government expects a takeover from all enemy hands and the complete eradication of all enemy forces. This is the only way to achieve a new population of humanity. To this end, initial arrangements were made to resettle the chosen people.<br/>
The government will soon start sending secret messages and transmitting the coded tickets for a new life on the planet “Earth One”. We regret to inform Commander that a ticket costs 1 million Global, we expect tumultuous conditions and expect a victory announcement shortly. A place on “Earth One” has been secured for you, but only if you achieve the mission objective!<br/>
<br/>
The new planet “Earth One” must be freed from the alien spiders and the professor, otherwise there is a risk of destruction and global collapse.<br/>
<br/>
That's why we make them -------------- Commander the savior of humanity!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
