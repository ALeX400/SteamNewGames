							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich.

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Your goal is to guide Czechoslovak soldiers back home onboard an armored train, but the path ahead is fraught with peril.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A mysterious ghost story, a gripping thriller, a historical adventure:<br>
Virginia and Professor MacNara, a famous archaeologist, come upon a 500 year-old galleon on the beach of a deserted village.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Barely Racing is an isometric view racing game, inspired strongly by Death Rally and other old-school racing games. However, we spiced it up a bit with online play and weapon choice. <br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>7 cars, with color customization.<br/></li><li>9 tracks, with reverse variant, across 3 biomes.<br/></li><li>Machine guns, rockets, and mines are your weapon of choice.<br/></li><li>Game is primarily made to be played in split screen, but there is a story mode too.<br/></li><li>Online multiplayer is supported, but it is peer to peer, which means your online match quality highly depends on the person who created the server.<br/></li><li>Single player story where you race to win the cups?</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351480/extras/BR_Garage.gif?t=1703835102"><br/><br/><strong>LOCAL AND ONLINE MULTIPLAYER</strong><br/>This game is meant to be played with your friends. Don't hesitate to challenge them. It is not a surprise that games like these are best enjoyed in multiplayer.<br/><br/><strong>MULTIPLAYER MODES</strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Race - just a regular race like any other. Addition of mines, rockets and machine guns, might change that experience a bit.<br/></li><li>Mine Tag - good old tag game, but this time you carry a mine that has a timeout. Better hurry up to touch (tag) someone before it explodes. <br/></li><li>Flag Chase - take the flag and hold it as much as possible. <br/></li><li>Football - soccer + cars. <br/></li><li>Deathmatch - wreckfest, just destroy every car you see</li></ul><br/><strong>HOW TO WIN A RACE?</strong><br/>Well, you need to be the first one to cross the finish line. If you have anyone in front of you, use dem rockets and machine gun. If you have someone behind, just drop a mine, they'll do the rest.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1351480/extras/BR_Weapons.gif?t=1703835102"><br/><br/><strong>DRIFTY DRIVING MODEL</strong><br/>We don't drive trams here, so expect some drift.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>This is a very cool role-playing Snake game. Our design focuses on the combat experience of each character, spending a lot of time adjusting scene effects, skill effects, sound effects, and game difficulty. Now each greedy snake has 8 different skills. Their skills will have certain characteristics, and each character will bring you a different experience. We are committed to the transformation of the casual attributes of the game, the simplest interaction and the simplest character development system (as the time of using the character increases, the character will become stronger and stronger). Unlocking characters mainly depends on clearing the game and defeating enemies. The game provides unlimited levels, and the difficulty of all levels will gradually increase. In the constant game challenges, you will obtain Stean achievements and challenge rankings. The game provides local single-player mode and two-player mode. You are welcome to play with your friends.</strong> </div></div>]]></description>

							In this score attack mini game, navigate through the dark garden carefully and search for your friends. Save as many friends as you can before the evil entity kills you! The amount of friends saved is your highest score. How many of your friends can you save?<br/><br/>Features include a saved high score! Yeah I know, another one of these on here. Not much to say about gameplay, but its dark so navigate carefully before running into friends.<br/><br/>Anyways...<br/><br/>Hello netizens, just a worried mom here that made a mini game for my ten year old daughter and sharing it with the world. She loves video games and loves being in the garden. This mini game I made for her is what she describes as what happens in our garden when friends visit. My daughter always talks about how this monster is always chasing them around. Our garden is openly attached to a forest, so a lot of her neighborhood friends run through it to get home from school.<br/><br/>My daughter has been upset and extremely sad as of recently due to three people in the area that have gone missing. A mother, the mother's cousin, and the mother's daughter who was my daughter's friend. The main reason why I made this was to keep us distracted from the glooming news. She wanted me to make something where she was the main character that saved everyone from this monster. Vain selfie below, just wanted to show you all who I am and if there are any other moms out there to relate and communicate with.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2708180/extras/Steam_DGZ.png?t=1703777461"><br/><br/>Once again my daughter recently just stood in our garden staring at the forest for hours. She would always scream, telling me the monster was there eating her friend, albeit there was absolutely nothing there. I don't understand, I can't see what she sees nor do I believe her, although I want to. It's all just eerie to me even if I'm playing along. Her behavior is also due to a lack of certain medication which keeps her calm. My job doesn't provide health insurance for us, so I've been buying her meds normally using savings and donations.<br/><br/>This time I want to give something in return to those who help us. This mini game project was a great bonding experience with my daughter. She illustrated concepts and cemented ideas for me to program. Now that development is complete, she's lost interest in wanting to try it out. She tells me she's too afraid to play it. Although I'm a bit frustrated about her not wanting to, I understand. This project will always be here for her whenever she's ready. Thank you everyone for reading and whatever you can give is appreciated!<br/><br/>Update: On 10/20/2023 two more people have gone missing in the area. Local detectives have reported difficulty finding any evidence of their location. The fear is infecting my head and my daughter's behavior has gotten uncontrollable. Something horrific is going on that is completely beyond my understanding.						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Greg, decorated American military veteran, was tasked by the United States military to solve the alien epidemic because of his brave actions in the last World War on earth.<br>
He has been in a coma in a forgotten hospital trapped by a foreign non-terrestrial being for decades. Dreams of his past life and family has awakened him.<br>
Greg awakes from his coma and realizes he's not the only one in the dark, lifeless, and forgotten building and that he must vanish the alien. He remembers he had a gun on him before the alien captured him.<br>
Find and use your weapon and/or radar and hide behind walls, under tables, and closed doors to escape the alien. Be careful when you explore the hospital as the alien can hear you walk when you least expect it.<br>
Greg is confident he can use his gun and/or stealth tactics to escape the alien, gather items that can be used to expel alien life on earth, and return to his glory and family and live life like before his coma and the last World War that happened.<br>
There is a radar and/or a gun that you can use to complete your mission and track the alien's location and make sure he is out of your way and also a lighter to light your way in dark areas in the abandoned hospital because the lights have gotten dimmer each year you have been asleep, will Greg persevere and have some normality after being asleep in this foreign fortress for decades?						</br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Attacker, coward, swindler or endgame wizard: I'll show you how to win against anyone! After my World Championship victories in 2022 and 2023, I am the reigning Chess Software World Champion and am now looking forward to showing you how to become even stronger against your opponent With my innovative training method, I simulate typical player personalities you know from tournaments and online chess: brash attackers, cautious cowards, passive players. But how do you win against them? Fritz will show you how! And for beautiful attacks, combinations or sacrifices, there are the new ChessBase cards as a reward for you. Practical training that's also a lot of fun. Or let's train openings: you can try out a new repertoire ideas directly in a match against me. And how about the new calculation training for a quick Elo boost? As Fritz19 I can make you play better again.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707140/extras/Fritz19_2e.jpg?t=1703750480"><br/>Fritz 18 marked the beginning of a new era, and Fritz 19 drives this development onward: a game against Fritz should be more than just a game - it should be an experience. In a time when online chess dominates, a chess program has to offer something special to be a real alternative to human opponents.<h2 class="bb_tag">In Fritz 19 it works like this</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>There are six different characters that mimic typical club players: Allrounder, Aggressive, Positional, Swindler, Fearful, Endgame Expert.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fritz plays human moves that fit these types, but builds-in tactical mistakes so that you can win with a sacricial attack, for example. The sharper the position, the more likely the program will misstep.</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li>There is a wide range of tips and support that you can use to the full, or ignore, depending on your mood. With all the tips, you will practically always win against the “strong club player” level. If you ignore them completely, it becomes challenging for a player like me (ELO 2000).</li></ul> <ul class="bb_ul"><li>At any time during the game, you can switch to “assisted calculation” mode. Where is no clock, so you can train your calculation without stress in positions you have played yourself. This has an enormous training benefit.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The opponent zoo</h2>The character Allrounder is probably the strongest opponent for every level of play. It is a development of “Easy Game” from Fritz 18. Everyone knows the Aggressive Player from their club. They regularly play on the attack, with a sharp opening repertoire. They are the ideal opponent for defence training with Black. The Swindler takes aggressiveness to the extreme, and o!en overplays the position. Material and solid position are of no interest, the main thing is to go for the king. Against this swindling fox, one usually has a material advantage, but suddenly it becomes highly dangerous. The wise owl symbolises the Positional Player. It loves a good pawn structure, a secure king of its own and coordinated piece-play. The distorted echo of this, is the fearful mouse. It appreciates crowded, safe positions and is afraid of complications. That is why it often plays weaker. The Endgame Fan, on the other hand, plays specifically for exchange. Simplification is paramount, the opening is o!en unambitious. When it comes to the endgame, on the other hand, things get really tough. An effective training opponent for this phase of the game!<h2 class="bb_tag">New opening training</h2>We all manage our opening repertoire in variation trees, stored in databases. If you want to play against it, it gets technical: opening books have to be converted. On today’s powerful computers, this has become obsolete. In Fritz 19, you play directly against databases, your own repertoire, or an opening article from the ChessBase Magazine!<br/><br/>If the White player, the Black player, the tournament title, or the source begins with “White” or “Black”, then all the moves in this game belong to this colour. Fritz will then only play these moves. A repertoire is always rather narrow from the point of view of one’s own colour and broad for the opponent’s moves. Try it out: Your Najdorf repertoire with Black against the “aggressive” player! Tip for ChessBase users: Save a generated opening survey from ChessBase and play against it immediately<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707140/extras/Fritz19_3e.jpg?t=1703750480"><h2 class="bb_tag">What else is available</h2>The new engine in Fritz 19 is the Computer Chess World Champion for 2023. The Calculation Training has been extended, especially in the important preliminary query of candidate moves. The Buddy Engine and the annotated engine analysis from ChessBase 17 have found their way into Fritz. The notation (and the whole program interface) has been enormously enhanced in places. Tactical Analysis, the important full commentary of your games, has been improved and much more!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2707140/extras/Fritz19_4e.jpg?t=1703750480"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Pray for the World. Feed the Ducks.</strong><br/><br/>You play as an Orthodox Christian monastic who has gone to their favorite lakeside to pray and feed the ducks. With prayer rope in hand and pocket full of peas (bread is bad for their digestion), humbly quiet your heart while caring for the least of God's creatures.<br/><br/>Pixel Monk is a casual game about acquiring a peaceful spirit: an experience players can enjoy through interactive background elements and ambient sounds. The game features two leisurely actions: Pray, and Feed the Ducks, both of which interact with the environment in different ways. Players can also mix a variety of calming sounds, toggle daytime and weather, and cycle through inspirational quotes from the Bible and Orthodox Saints.<br/><br/>In Pixel Monk you can choose between:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Male or Female Monastic (with option for Angelic Schema robe)<br/></li><li> 10 Classical Piano songs<br/></li><li> 5 Mixable Ambient Sounds: Ducks, Wind, Rain, Frogs, Crickets<br/></li><li> 4 Orthodox Christian Icons: Christ, Theotokos, Venerable Monk, Holy Virgin<br/></li><li> 50+ quotes from Holy Scripture and Orthodox Saints<br/></li><li> Launch the game during Orthodox feast days (Old or New Calendar) to find special Icons and background items.</li></ul><br/>Pixel Monk is ultimately an experience, aimed at inspiring that same experience in the real world. In the hustle and bustle of life we may not always get to retreat to our favorite place to find peace, but we hope that Pixel Monk can bring players a small part of that peace until then.						</div></div>]]></description>
