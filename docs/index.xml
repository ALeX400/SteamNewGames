<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2729710/extras/Final_Render_1.gif?t=1704482033"><br/><br/>"Don't Touch My Phone" is not just your ordinary 2D side-scrolling platform adventure—it's a hilarious escapade that follows the misadventures of a six-year-old boy desperately trying to connect with his crush, Susan. The catch? He's phoneless! To chat with Susan, he must sneak into other people's phones, but it's anything but easy. These digital devices are fortified with guns, wires, bombs, mines, nukes, and heavy weapons, turning each level into a wacky obstacle course.<br/><br/>The game revels in its intentional silliness, throwing absurd challenges at our pint-sized hero. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use your smarts to navigate this ludicrous landscape, outwit the phone defenses, and win Susan's heart. Can you help the boy overcome these comically exaggerated obstacles? Brace yourself for a laughter-filled adventure that's as funny as it is tricky! Get ready to dive into a world where the absurd meets the amusing, and where the journey to romance is anything but conventional!<br/><br/>.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2729710/extras/Glitch_01.gif?t=1704482033"><br/>..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2729710/extras/Heavy_Weapons.gif?t=1704482033"><br/>..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2729710/extras/And_More.gif?t=1704482033"><h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><br/>* Discover a world worth exploring.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A hidden object game where you must find all the cats and wool to complete each level.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2>🖼️ 15 Unique artworks<br/>❓ 1500+ Hidden objects total<br/>🐈 750+ Cats<br/>🧶 750+ Wool<br/> 💡 ∞ Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br/>♻️ Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br/>🎵 Music for each artwork<br/>⌨️ Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br/>💾 3x save slots<br/>🗑️ Reset progress entirely and play again<br/>🕒 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class="bb_tag">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many cats and wool as they can inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a cat or wool, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class="bb_tag">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to DweebCon, the pop culture convention that everyone's dying to attend -- even you! This convention is your only chance to meet the new, high-tech animatronics based on your favorite vtuber group, VchiBan! And you're determined to meet your oshis at any cost.<br>
<br>
The only problem is that their meet-and-greet sold out before you could buy a ticket; limited supply and all that. The only way you'll be able to meet your oshis at Dweebcon is by breaking into the convention center and counterfeiting a ticket. Y'know, as one does.<br>
<br>
You have the ticket file and the best printer in the world; all it will take is one good print of the ticket. This shouldn't take too long, right?  Throughout five nights, you must remain hidden within the convention center security office as the printer churns away at your prized possession. You'll have to micromanage the printer and deal with mechanical issues such as the ink running out or the fuses bursting.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, your oshis are roaming the convention center, eager to meet you even before you have your ticket. Be careful to conserve power, as the shutters and lights use electricity, and the convention center is strict about power usage within the security booth.<br>
<br/>
And if you run out of power -- or if your oshis find you before you have your ticket...? You're a gamer, I'm sure this will be no problem for you.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Long into future there are no heroes or villains, no stolen princesses or fearsome dragons, no priests to disturb or burning witches to put ot of fire, yet there is one thing to have: fun. Endless battles in endlessly generated worlds is the main thing you will find in this rouguelite bullet hell. Fight your way through, live as much as you can or just have fun, die and restart. <br>
<br>
Once your cross the riverline - the timer begins to tick, and your goal is to fight as well as you can until the time runs out. The world itself is infinitely generated, so you will never have problems with finding new battles and treasures, but the futher from the starting line you go - the harsher it gets. <br>
<br>
One of the most important mechanics (aside from running and shooting) is timer: you start with some time, and every moment you play a lottery: advance further and get more treasure and more time, taking risk of finding none, or turn back and return to the starting line safely? The choice is yours. <br>
<br>
Inspired by 80-s arcade masterpieces, such as robotron and bubbles, this game gives you nothing but a pure gameplay with no distractions.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Get ready for exciting naval combat with Boaty Tanks 2! <br>
Take control of a small boat as you navigate through various biomes, armed with your trusty weapons. But be warned - enemy ships are out to get you! Engage in intense battles as you shoot and destroy these despicable foes, testing your reflexes and aiming skills. Immerse yourself in the thrilling world of boat combat. Survive challenging fights and show off your boat-shooting skills today!<br>
<br>
In this game, you play as a boat that is trying to defend itself from an invasion of opposing ships. <br>
Each level begins in a different biome with different obstacles, styles, and decorations, teeming with enemies. <br>
Once the enemies have spotted you they start moving towards you and start shooting at you with relatively slow flying bullets. You are able to outmaneuver your enemies by simply dodging their bullets or diving beneath them. Then you can use your front or side cannons to fight back against them by shooting at them. At the end of each level waits a big opponent with more energy and bigger bullets. You have 3 lives before the game ends, so be careful not to get hit by a bullet.						</br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
