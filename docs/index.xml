At the start, simple clicks will harvest resources, create housing &amp; production buildings, and assign workers to craft items. You'll choose which items to sell at the markets, and which to refine into better items. As you gain experience, you'll acquire tools that help automatically manage your growing town - which you will need in order to manage its increasing demands.<br/><br/>Eventually you will gain the ability to expand into exotic biomes, unlocking valuable resources &amp; recipes exclusive to those regions. All along, you'll need to invest your earnings back into research and upgrades so that your town can earn you increasingly large piles of coins.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Make gourmet food, machinery, fine clothing, books of knowledge, potions, enchanted jewelry, and many other types of items<br/></li><li>Discover new recipes as your production skills increase<br/></li><li>Cultivate crops and prospect for ores to boost natural resources<br/></li><li>Huge list of quests which unlock powerful perks when completed<br/></li><li>Use aqueducts, water wheels, steam power, electricity, farm equipment, trains and research labs to give your production a boost<br/></li><li>Several different Biomes with unique resources, as well as advantages &amp; weaknesses to work around<br/></li><li>Exchange goods between multiple towns to maximize the benefit of local specialties<br/></li><li>Detailed production stats let you know where your bottlenecks are so you can keep your supply chain flowing<br/></li><li>Set production limits and priorities to precisely allocate your resources<br/></li><li>While away from the game, you earn Time Tokens you can use to fast-forward the simulation when you're ready to play again</li></ul><br/>(Trailer music from the original Factory Town soundtrack, by Clark Aboud)						</div></div>]]></description>

Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game.

You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to Goofy Gorillas, the largest (and greatest) nostalgia-driven virtual play centre!<br/><br/>Do you want to play Hide and Seek with your friends? Maybe you'd want to play Hide and Seek with dodgeballs, inflatable hammers and boxing gloves to raise the stakes a little more? Why not turn your friends into enemies in a free-for-all battle with all of the items mentioned? You and your friends can partake in these activities while also earning GP (Goofy Points). Levels are gained through earning GP, which can then be used to unlock unique cosmetic items to show off while you're winning in your game mode of choice!<br/><br/>If you just want to chill without the fear of being chased or you don't feel like turning your friends into enemies just yet, we have you covered! Goofy Gorillas prioritizes creating a social hub before any game mode begins, so you're able to do whatever you want to do - with small mini-games that can be played at any time too! <br/><br/>Goofy Gorillas is fitted with a football (soccer) pitch with a working score counter hidden within the play area, a bowling alley with two lanes also hidden within the play area, 2 large ball pits with large slides and there are some basketball hoops scattered around the entire venue - some easier to dunk than others! We hope there is something here for everyone!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAMEMODES</strong></h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Hide &amp; Seek</h2><br/>The classic game that everyone knows so well. Seekers must find all of the Hiders in the given time, and every round, both teams swap sides! Sounds simple, right? Well in Goofy Gorillas, we take it to the next level! Featuring an economy just for this gamemode, Hiders and Seekers have access to a shop with items and utility that will help them defend themselves as a Hider, or help catching the Hiders in style as a Seeker. <br/><br/>You want to make the Seekers slip on a banana peel? You can totally do that! <br/><br/>You want to hit the Hiders with an inflatable hammer? We highly encourage you to do that!<h2 class="bb_tag">Infector</h2><br/>Infector is another classic game. It plays just like Hide &amp; Seek, just without the economy. One player is chosen as the Infector, and by catching the Runners, they too will become an Infector. Once everyone has been caught, the Infector team will win... or lose if there's just a single player still standing. The first player that gets caught will be the Infector in the next round.<br/><br/>Be careful who you trust in this gamemode; once your "friend" has been caught, they will not be your friend anymore!<h2 class="bb_tag">Free For All</h2><br/>The standard of any multiplayer game. This is the perfect gamemode for those who want to mindlessly cause chaos with friends! Just spawn in with an item, get stuck in the brawl and come out on top, or just respawn with another item if you weren't successful! The first player to reach the score limit wins, or if no one reaches that, then the time limit will decide who becomes victorious!<br/><br/><br/>With all of these activities included, we hope you enjoy your time here at Goofy Gorillas!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>The Galleon has been infested with spooky monsters! Rally your band of rogues to take them out and delve deeper into the cursed ship.</i><br/><br/><strong>Fight</strong><br/>Rogue Galleon is a top-down shooter + rogue-lite, offering different characters and weapons you can use against various monsters. Each floor gets progressively harder; the further you go, the more monsters spawn, and stronger monsters will begin to appear too. At the end of each floor, you can pick from a selection of upgrades to power yourself up too. These offer increased DPS or survivability, or add some utility effect.<br/><br/><strong>Collect</strong><br/>Every monsters has a chance to drop some amount of gold, but the most lucrative rewards come from the Bonus Gold system. On floor 1 and every 5 floors beyond, you are given the "Disciplined Heart" and "Relentless Timer". The Heart breaks if you take damage, and the Timer breaks if if a countdown runs out. If 5 floors are cleared with either one intact, a large sum of gold is rewarded, and each is reset.<br/><br/><strong>Unlock</strong><br/>When certain conditions are met, a new playable character will unlock. Each character has a special ability and comes with a unique weapon as well. Weapons are not restricted to the character they come with, so experiment to find your favourite combo!<br/><br/><strong>Spend</strong><br/>When you die, you are sent back to the Armoury and lose the upgrades you picked. But not all is lost - you keep some of the gold you found. This gold can be spent at merchants to unlock permanent power - this is how you get further and further into the game. These unlocks can increase the gold you gain, let you take more upgrades, power up certain characters, and much more.<br/><br/><strong>Progress</strong><br/>The further you go, the more gold you can earn. The more gold, the more unlocks. The more unlocks, the further you can go... but can you get far enough to uncover the source of the horde of monsters...?						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							CaS-Puz is a 3D puzzle platformer where everything is based on the position of the camera. You look at the wall from one side — it exists. You look from the other — you can go through it. But you have to open and close them for your own purposes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2518250/extras/1_2_600_Squeeze.gif?t=1704911137"><br/><br/>However, you can't stand on open walls, and you can't jump away from them. During maneuvers, you will have to both open and close many walls.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2518250/extras/2_2_600_Squeeze.gif?t=1704911137"><br/><br/><strong>Easy to learn — hard to master.</strong> The controls are straightforward and standard — relative to the camera. Just to keep the direction of movement, you will have to change controls on the fly. <br/><br/><strong>A puzzle and a platformer.</strong> Before you make a jump, look around and think. Understand the correct sequence of jumps and camera turns.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2518250/extras/3_1_Squeeze.gif?t=1704911137"><br/><br/>If you are a fan of hardcore platformers, then in CaS-Puz you will definitely find a new challenge for yourself.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"ISOLAND4: The Anchor of Memory" belongs to which part of the ISOLAND series? Does it continue the story from "ISOLAND3: The Dust of the Universe," or does it start a new chapter? Can it truly unravel the past and present of the Lost Island?<br/><br/>You'll only know after you've played it yourself. Wait a moment... even after playing, you might not necessarily know. :)<br/><br/>Since the first ISOLAND, this journey has been full of twists and turns, both in the game and in real life.<br/><br/>ISOLAND4 continues to pay homage to literature, art, and music like its predecessors, with more intricate maps and puzzles. However, the foundation lies in richer Easter eggs, more mystical dialogues, and more abundant emotions.<br/><br/>This installment emphasizes the characters in the story, featuring both familiar and new faces. They assist you in rediscovering the island's secrets while unraveling their own life mysteries.<br/><br/><strong>Do not overlook any detail; do not miss any conversation.</strong><br/><br/>Things that seem useless may offer players more contemplation on the fate of life.<br/><br/>This ISOLAND is dedicated to my mother.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2700230/extras/游戏封面图.jpg?t=1704853795"> </img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2748400/extras/Steam_About_Image.png?t=1704824159"><br/>Wield god powers and command legions of elemental thralls against your friends! Elemental Engagements is a split screen, versus, real-time-strategy game. Gain favor with the elemental gods to use their 16 powers, battle on 3 maps, and play with either Keyboard or Controller!<h2 class="bb_tag">Elemental God Powers</h2>As a major wind god, you'll wield wind powers. However, winning the favor of the other gods will grant you fire, water, and earth god powers.<br/>Use wind to control the battlefield! Use fire to damage your opponent! Use water to support your units! Use earth to deny enemy movement!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2748400/extras/GodPowerExample_SteamDescription.gif?t=1704824159"><h2 class="bb_tag">Sacrifice and Gain Favor</h2>As a match progresses, you can choose which elements you will sacrifice your thralls to. The more territory you capture, the more favor and god powers you will gain for the associated elements, but you can only have a limited amount! This means that no game will play the same and each player must choose their sacrifices wisely.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2748400/extras/FavorExample_SteamDescription.gif?t=1704824159"><h2 class="bb_tag">Pick Up &amp; Play</h2>Elemental Engagements is a progressively-faster paced game on match by match basis. This means that most matches will last 5-20 minutes. The controls are designed specifically for the gamepad and split-screen gameplay, so RTS veterans and casual players alike will find tons of fun and room to strategize!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2748400/extras/Steam_About_Image_End.png?t=1704824159"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
