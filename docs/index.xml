<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of one of the three adventurers: youthful French aristocrat, a formidable Spanish mercenary, or a savvy English entrepreneur. Explore, trade, plunder, complete quests and enjoy the Caribbean Open World. This game has the most of improvements and a good portion of new content from the upcoming Caribbean Legend. <strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/steamchar2.jpg?t=1707850966"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имени-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The Caribbean is your domain, offering everything from exploring ancient pyramids to capturing entire towns.<br/></li><li><strong>Hundred Recurring Quests</strong>: Engage in a myriad of quests, each with multiple potential outcomes, including freight jobs, bounty hunting, trading contracts, and more!<br/></li><li><strong>Unique Quests:</strong> Embark on twenty distinctive quests, each with its own compelling narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Land and Naval Warfare</strong>: Transition from confronting thugs in jungles and pirating a small game to leading full-scale sieges and commanding an armada of warships.<br/></li><li><strong>Extensive Customisation</strong>: Tailor your experience with character builds, dozens of ships, and a vast array of over a hundred items and weapons.<br/></li><li><strong>Side Activities</strong>: Immerse yourself in a wide range of activities, including crafting, trading, duels, gambling, smuggling, romance, ship upgrading, and treasure hunting.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имениdd-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/>Caribbean Legend: Sandbox is at the beginning of its journey as we aim to create the ultimate pirate freeplay game. This game is still under development, and while we haven't finalized all the main future milestones, our general vision is already taking shape. The old Sea Dogs approach primarily focused on expanding quest content. When a player completed all available side quests, their journey in the game would come to an end. This approach wasn't necessarily flawed, but we're excited to explore a new direction. <br/><br/>What if the game consistently generated one-of-a-kind situations for players, ensuring each playthrough remains captivating and distinctive, from the early game to the very end? Let's discover the possibilities! Based on sales of the full game and community feedback, the following roadmap may undergo adjustments, to the lesser or (hopefully!) the bigger scale. <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/en-roadmap.png?t=1707850966"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming. Each R2G title is a tribute to a single hit game from the '90s: a reimagining of a single universal story for a brand-new audience, using modern means and innovative, often vastly simplified gameplay mechanics.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/pillars.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> was first envisioned as a new game mode inside the Book of Demons universe, but we soon realized that its design is huge and that it should be executed as a stand-alone spin-off game.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2 class="bb_tag">How to play the game</h2>The game has three levels: <strong>Easy, Ok and Ouch</strong>. The names indicate the relative degree of difficulty of each level. To finish a level you must complete each of the 15 boards within the level. After completing the <strong>Easy</strong> level, you move to <strong>Ok</strong> and then <strong>Ouch</strong>. You may start at any level, but a useful tactic is to start at a less challenging level and build up a store of extra lives to sustain you at higher levels.<br/><br/>Gameplay takes place on a series of boards each consisting of nine rows and nine columns of tiles. Each tile may be one of two colours. For example, these tiles are used on the initial Robotica board.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/tiles1and2.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>The player is represented by a smiley-faced character on the board.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/players.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>The player moves the character from tile to tile by using a gamepad joystick, or the arrow keys (left,right,up,down or W,A,S,D).<br/><br/>When the player lands on a tile, if the tile is already the player's colour, nothing happens and no points are awarded. If the tile was not the player's colour then it will be instantly changed to the player's colour and points will be awarded.<br/><br/>If the tile is changed and, in conjunction with another tile of the player's colour, encloses one or more tiles of the other colour, then those other tiles will flip to the player's colour. Each tile flipped is awarded an increasing number of points, so flipping longer lines is more rewarding than flipping shorter ones. This is the main game mechanic.<br/><br/>The following images should help to explain how it works.<br/><br/>First the player jumps onto another tile:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/explain1.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>The tile changes instantly to the player's colour, enclosing one or more tiles of the opposing colour by two player tiles:<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/explain2.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>The enclosed tiles flip to the player's colour:<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/explain3.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>Each tile flipped is awarded an increasing number of points:<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/explain4.png?t=1707898447"><br/><br/>Lines may be flipped horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/><br/>This mechanism is similar to that used in the strategy board game called Reversi, said to have been invented by an Englishman in 1883.<h2 class="bb_tag">Teleportation</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/teleport.png?t=1707898447"><br/>If the player jumps onto a tile overlaid with a teleport symbol, then the player will be directly transported to another tile at random. At more challenging levels, fewer teleports are available and may disappear at random when used, but will reappear some time later.<h2 class="bb_tag">Adversaries</h2>Each board comes with a number of adversaries. They are called chasers and initially appear in a cage to the left of the board. There is a hole in the bottom corner of the cage, which the chasers can use to gain access to the board. Only a limited number of chasers are allowed on the board at any one time. When the chasers appear on the board they will try to collide with the player's character. If they are successful, the player will lose a life and the board will be restarted. Initially the chasers move quite randomly, but as time passes they begin to hunt the player more zealously. As the chasers move about the board they flip the player tiles to the other colour. The chaser tile flipping occurs in the same manner as the player flipping, except that the flipping is instantaneous, not animated as for the player. The chasers are different for each board, for example the chasers for the Robotica board are:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/chasers.png?t=1707898447"><h2 class="bb_tag">How to complete a board</h2>Jumping around the board scoring points is all very well, but how do you complete a board? To complete a board you must kill all of the chasers. You can kill a chaser by flipping the tile beneath it. When sufficient chasers have been killed the final adversary from the cage, the destroyer, will be released. The destroyer will proceed to jump from tile to tile destroying each tile that it lands upon, reducing the size of the board. You must kill the remaining chasers before the destroyer consumes the board and eventually the player. You cannot kill the destroyer and collision with the destroyer will result in the loss of a life. For the Robotica board the destroyer looks like:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/destroyer.png?t=1707898447"><h2 class="bb_tag">Pick-ups</h2>Whenever a chaser is killed, by flipping the tile beneath it, there is the chance that a pick-up, or hazard, may be generated. The pick-ups that are common to all boards are listed below. In general, a pick-up that is beneficial to the player, will be portrayed by a slowly rotating icon. To acquire the pick-up, and reap the benefits associated with it, the player simply has to jump upon the same tile that the pick-up occupies. The benefits of each pick-up are:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/heart.png?t=1707898447"><br/>The heart pick-up increments the number of lives that the player has remaining. The player starts the game with an initial tally of five lives. If the player loses all lives then the game is over. A heart pick-up will appear when the player flips a chaser having scored 10,000 points, or more. Another heart pick-up will appear after every additional 10,000 points scored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/shield.png?t=1707898447"><br/>The shield pick-up wraps the player in a protective bubble. If the player collides with one of the four chasers, then the chaser will be killed - the hunters become the hunted. The shield lasts for about 10 seconds, after which time it will flash briefly and disappear. The shield duration is cumulative, so jumping on two shields, one after the other, will afford the player about 20 seconds of protection. Note the shield only protects the player from the four original chasers, not the destroyer or other hazards that may appear.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/speed.png?t=1707898447"><br/>The super-speed pick-up allows the player to move at double speed for about 10 seconds. Again, the super-speed pick-ups are cumulative and are particularly devastating if you are also protected by a shield. You should exercise care when travelling at super-speed, as it becomes more difficult to navigate accurately.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hazards</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/flamer.png?t=1707898447"><br/>There is one particular chaser which poses an additional threat. Sometimes, one of the chasers, always the same type, will pause and breathe flames for a short period. If the player is caught by the flames, a life will be lost.<br/><br/>Occasionally, when a line of tiles is flipped, one of them will shatter, leaving a hole, which randomly moves around the board. The player cannot jump onto a hole, so it provides an obstacle to navigation.<br/><br/>The remaining pick-ups and hazards generated by killing a chaser are specific to each board. To read a full description about pick-ups, refer to the in-game help menu. For the initial Robotica board the hazards are:<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/oil.png?t=1707898447"><br/><strong>The oil slick</strong>. An oil slick  is non-fatal to the player. If the player lands upon it he will slide onto another tile without landing on the tile covered by the oil slick.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796280/extras/saw.png?t=1707898447"><br/><strong>The saw.</strong> A saw  is potentially fatal to the player. The saw moves randomly up and down, or side to side. If the player collides with the saw a life will be lost.<h2 class="bb_tag">Level Completion</h2>When all 15 boards have been completed, the player proceeds to the next level. When the final Ouch level has been completed, the game is finished and any remaining lives are multiplied by 10,000 and added to the total score.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

							that is, a rich planting experience. At the same time, new concepts such as Sprites have been added to enrich the game, and the details have also been repeatedly polished and improved.<br>
<br>
In terms of planting, we have improved the problem of insufficient guidance at the beginning that was raised a lot in the previous work. Appropriately provide planting methods, while reducing the difficulty, retain the fun of players' own exploration. In addition, pest control and weed control are enriched. The task system has also been newly added, and there will be new tasks waiting for you to challenge in each stage!<br>
<br>
In terms of new content, you are likely to meet some new friends. You can sell the eggplant to NPC Momo, or you can learn a mysterious story from the sprites. And the exploration of this part of the content is also inseparable from your planting ability.<br>
<br>
Oh, in this work, a mechanism that the game will fail when the plant dies is removed, so that you have more space to explore, and you will meet sprites as soon as possible. I hope you will like it.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<br>
Equipped with P・L・S (Pilot Level Score) system! The difficulty level changes depending on the player's skill. As the difficulty level increases, the score increase rate also increases!<br>
Challenge your high score in caravan mode!<br>

<br/>
story<br/>
A galaxy far, far away.<br/>
The inhabitants of the planet Zelan, which was on the verge of extinction due to resource depletion and climate change, were proceeding with plans to develop and colonize other planets in search of a new world.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, an incident occurs in which ships departing from Zeran go missing one after another.<br/>
<br/>
From the communication records, it is revealed that the series of events was caused by an invasion by Alien Muldark.<br/>
Eventually, Moldark's forces take control of Zelan's satellite base.<br/>
Most of the regular army Zeran Force, which was supposed to protect Zeran, had left Zeran to protect the pioneer fleet, so the remaining army faced off against Muldark's army, but suffered a devastating blow.<br/>
<br/>
Pilot Levi Kuzier, who was injured and away from his mission, boards the under-development aircraft ``Riserion'' and flies off into space alone in order to take back the occupied satellite base.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">About</h2>Following "Trajectory of summer flower", the official production team SoraPrayer brings you the authentic sequel. This story unfolds ten years after the events of the previous installment. Unlike the portrayal of rural feudalistic customs from an urbanite's perspective in the previous work, this installment takes a different approach. It follows a youth, native to Tangxia Village, providing a perspective rooted in indigenous culture to depict the hidden feudalistic darkness and customs within Chinese villages more profoundly. Additionally, this installment emphasizes the theme of "family", and the humorous and comedic daily life elements from the previous work are preserved authentically, ensuring that you will not find this realistic and poignant subject matter dull. The protagonists and related characters from the previous work will also play crucial roles in this installment, interacting with the new main character, offering you a fresh perspective on the beautiful love story among the youths in the summer countryside.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Little is known about Tangxia Village, a secluded small mountain village. The scenery here is picturesque, with a perpetual summer-like atmosphere throughout the seasons. For most people, it is like a utopia, but beneath this beauty, this village is rife with feudalistic customs incongruent with its idyllic surroundings. Human trafficking, gender bias, and archaic rituals such as ghost marriage persist in the village, remnants of the old society's customs.<br/>The protagonist of the story, Ma Xiaodong, is the son of the Ma family, local landlords in this village. Living with his father, Ma Qingchen, his two sisters, Ma Minyi and Ma Wenhui, and his childhood friend, Zhu Qianyin, the five of them share a household. As the eldest son, Ma Xiaodong cherishes every day spent with his family, valuing them above all else.  Though his father occasionally treats him harshly, he remains committed to the principle of filial piety. <br/>Despite the seemingly peaceful surface, the inevitable conflict between personal growth and traditional beliefs creates tensions. Like a butterfly breaking free from its cocoon, changes in thoughts and contradictions with traditional values become apparent one summer. In this particular summer, long-hidden family secrets gradually surface. Faced with the impending darkness, the choices between change and tradition, how will the young boys and girls respond? Will the gears of their destiny begin to turn, propelling them towards new horizons? All the answers will be revealed in this summer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Character Introductions</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2698190/extras/intro_1.png?t=1707876052"><br/><strong>Zhu Qianyin</strong><br/>Character Voice: 桂圆翊宝<br/>BWH: 82/58/84<br/>Birthday: December 5<br/>Height: 156cm<br/>Weight: 43kg<br/>Of unknown origin, Zhu Qianyin has lived in the Ma family since childhood and is Ma Xiaodong's childhood friend.

She tends to spend money recklessly, exhausting her allowance every month and relying on Ma Xiaodong to "borrow" money, with repayment often forgotten.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2698190/extras/intro_5.png?t=1707876052"><br/><strong>Ma Qingchen</strong><br/>Character Voice: 来晓风<br/>Birthday: June 4<br/>Height: 179cm<br/>Weight: 60kg<br/>Ma Xiaodong's father and the head of the Ma family.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of one of the three adventurers: youthful French aristocrat, a formidable Spanish mercenary, or a savvy English entrepreneur. Explore, trade, plunder, complete quests and enjoy the Caribbean Open World. This game has the most of improvements and a good portion of new content from the upcoming Caribbean Legend. <strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/steamchar2.jpg?t=1707850966"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имени-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The Caribbean is your domain, offering everything from exploring ancient pyramids to capturing entire towns.<br/></li><li><strong>Hundred Recurring Quests</strong>: Engage in a myriad of quests, each with multiple potential outcomes, including freight jobs, bounty hunting, trading contracts, and more!<br/></li><li><strong>Unique Quests:</strong> Embark on twenty distinctive quests, each with its own compelling narrative.<br/></li><li><strong>Land and Naval Warfare</strong>: Transition from confronting thugs in jungles and pirating a small game to leading full-scale sieges and commanding an armada of warships.<br/></li><li><strong>Extensive Customisation</strong>: Tailor your experience with character builds, dozens of ships, and a vast array of over a hundred items and weapons.<br/></li><li><strong>Side Activities</strong>: Immerse yourself in a wide range of activities, including crafting, trading, duels, gambling, smuggling, romance, ship upgrading, and treasure hunting.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/Без_имениdd-3.png?t=1707850966"><br/>Caribbean Legend: Sandbox is at the beginning of its journey as we aim to create the ultimate pirate freeplay game. This game is still under development, and while we haven't finalized all the main future milestones, our general vision is already taking shape. The old Sea Dogs approach primarily focused on expanding quest content. When a player completed all available side quests, their journey in the game would come to an end. This approach wasn't necessarily flawed, but we're excited to explore a new direction. <br/><br/>What if the game consistently generated one-of-a-kind situations for players, ensuring each playthrough remains captivating and distinctive, from the early game to the very end? Let's discover the possibilities! Based on sales of the full game and community feedback, the following roadmap may undergo adjustments, to the lesser or (hopefully!) the bigger scale. <br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1782680/extras/en-roadmap.png?t=1707850966"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Be the hero the world needs in such a desperate time. A meteorite crashes into Earth, leaving a dangerous amount of radiation that engulfs a huge area of a city, horribly mutating humans and exposing them to lethal levels of radiation. Alongside the meteor, unknown celestial aliens arrive with plans unknown for the planet and a powerful yet dangerous substance known as celestial ore. This resource has many different properties depending on the human it reaches. It can be radioactive to lethal levels, transforming humans into raging, nearly mindless mutants aggressively and aimlessly fighting without end. In special cases, a few humans are mutated, granting them special abilities at random. These abilities can vary from lightning and super strength to super regeneration, fire, or anything else based on random mutations from person to person.<br/><br/>You fight against many powerful bosses and formidable foes willing to do anything to get their hands on celestial ore, to stop them from using it for their own evil purposes. On top of all that lies the bigger problem at hand: what exactly came down to Earth inside the meteor, what it is, and what will happen to the planet if it's not handled in time. It all depends on you as the last hope to save the world!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features</strong> <br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"> <li>Fight Powerful bosses.<br/><br/></li><li>Gain New Abilities.<br/><br/></li><li>Find New Weapons.</li></ul><br/>Trailer Music from - Symphonic_Metal_Music_For_Games by Intersonic Sound - Music - Aug 16, 2023						</div></div>]]></description>
