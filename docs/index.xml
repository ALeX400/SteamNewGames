<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Fk2N3rpRuB3" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/fc521c8bf21bff775962df4f130bb74eb5577a46.png?t=1709215291"/></a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif01.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders is an action-adventure RPG with base-building elements, where you take on the role of a classic hero who stands up to the tyranny and injustice that haunts Sherwood. As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

The first reel is the most important because you must match symbols from left to right starting with the first reel.<br/><br/>There are four main symbols that win big amounts, some basic symbols based on a deck of cards (Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten) that can win medium amounts and there are also three special symbols which we will explain below.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Wild_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Wild:</strong> The Wild symbol can match any other symbol in the game (except other special symbols)<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Scatter_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Scatter:</strong> The Scatter symbol is special because you can win just by having three or more of them on the screen in any position (hence the name scatter because they can be scattered about the reels).<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/Bonus_S.png?t=1709217142"><br/><br/><strong>Bonus:</strong> If you get three bonus symbols you enter a bonus game where you win free spins and keep all the winnings from enjoying those spins.<h2 class="bb_tag">Other Options</h2><br/><strong>Lines:</strong> There are three obvious lines you can match symbols on across the play area, but you can also match symbols on lines that aren't as obvious. By clicking the lines button you can see the lines being checked for matching symbols.<br/><br/><strong>Denominations:</strong> You can choose to play a penny per line or $10 per line each spin.<br/><br/><strong>Bet: </strong>The bet multiplier is how many coins based on your denomination you want to bet on each line per spin.<br/><br/><strong><i>Example: </i></strong>If your denomination is set to 1 cent, your bet multiplier is set to 1 and you are playing 20 lines per spin, each spin will cost 20 cents a spin [1x1x20].<h2 class="bb_tag">SPECIAL FEATURES - Slot Cabinet Owners<br/>CONTROLLER SUPPORT</h2><br/>Being a slots enthusiasts with real slot machines we have noticed that there is no software out there designed to work in a slot cabinet (or PC for that matter) that feel like the real slot machines (they always have extra user interface stuff on the screen that ruins the real feel of the slot game). So we made this software to fill that gap and intend to make many more (adult and non-adult) based slot games.<br/><br/>We have a special feature for slot cabinet builders / owners. We've included the ability to use a USB joypad encoder to play the games using a real slot machines buttons. The games fit a Ceronix type monitor at 1280x 1024 perfectly and feel like a real slot machine. 4:3 and 16:9 screen modes supported. We plan to add more cabinet features in future updates. If you have an old non-working slot machine or even a working slot machine with a multiple input monitor (many are, you should check) You can put a cheap computer into your slot cabinet and have the best of both worlds!<br/><br/>If you are playing on your PC, in a real Slot Cabinet, or building your own slot machine.. we have you covered and want to help make it a simple and fun project!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2833440/extras/USB_Controller.png?t=1709217142"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif02.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif05.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif04.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1159420/extras/gif03.gif?t=1709215291"><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You will play as a pancake chef, on a never-ending snack cart, constantly making “chinese crepes” for the customers who come by, and getting ratings and ingredients.<br/><br/>First sprinkle some flour, beat some eggs, add some scallions, and finally add some toppings, spread some sauce, and a piece of authentic 'Jianbing guozi' is freshly baked!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2> <ul class="bb_ul"><li>Cyberpunk art<br/></li><li>Sensational music<br/></li><li>Easy to play<br/></li><li>Rich ingredients<br/></li><li>Realistic cooking simulation<br/></li><li>Most items on the snack cart can be interacted with<br/></li><li>Immersive gaming experience</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>In 2098, although the technology of the earth has “progressed”, human civilization has taken another path. The “humanism” spirit brought by the Renaissance was replaced by “technologism”. People believe that the development of technology will bring unlimited freedom and even create infinite possibilities. For example, the invention of electronic brains allows people to truly feel what is “imagination without boundaries”. The invention of electronic limbs and auxiliary body parts allows people to see and accept the death of God in religion and the birth of God in technology.<br/><br/>People have become accustomed to and enjoy letting technology dominate everything, from birth to death, from three meals a day to work and leisure, as long as they have money, they can live like gods. There has never been a kind of capitalism that makes everyone so firmly believe in the power of money. Money buys technology, and technology summons God.<br/><br/>Of course, the remnants of the old enlightenment’s “humanism” have not been extinct. They can always survive on the edge of cities and networks. In 2098, in New Dragon City of the American Federation, an organization called “Imune” removes identity chips for people for free, to get rid of the information control of the capital government union on individuals. At the same time, the advertising department of Pineapple Dragon, the largest company in New Dragon City, is hunting down “Imune”. The player-controlled “chef” is one of the leaders of “Imune”. According to the law designated by Pineapple Dragon and the government, such a thought criminal as “Imune” will be subjected to “thought deprivation” punishment, implanting brain invasion accessors for criminals, and providing some customers with special services-legal brain invasion (role-playing), to deprive thought criminals of their right to use their own brains.<br/><br/>Some thought criminals will act as cleaners on the outer walls of skyscrapers, some will be arranged as executioners for illegal violent organizations, and of course, there are also some low-stimulation occupations, such as some thought criminals will be assigned to snack stalls as stall owners. It should be noted that this service is different from the “Braindance” system used by ordinary customers. After all, BD is just a kind of “replay”, but this service provides a kind of “realest experience”. Customers can see in reality the consequences caused by their own actions.<br/><br/>In snack cart No. 98, players will invade into the brain of a former leader of the “Imune” organization, play as a chef, cook pancakes and get feedback from “customers”.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Mysterious planets are located in the Maskros Nebula—a galaxy far away from Earth.<br>
<br>
In Pieces I: A Maskros Nebula Game, you solve three jigsaw puzzles that will give you a glimpse of three distant planets.<br>
<br>
- First, we take a look at the exteriors of the pizzeria "PizzaPastaMaro" in the cyber city Emoh, which is located on the planet CobeeDot. PPM was founded by Maro, a sentient android, and is frequented by many pizza fans in the city.<br>
<br>
- Next up is Nou-Raex—a planet not too far from CobeeDot that is rich in plants. Teenager Norx loves the quietude of the morning and enjoys his walks in the swamp.<br>
<br/>
- The third planet we visit is called Eskolea (or "Downpourlea" to its inhabitants). This rather dystopian planet is characterized by rainy, stormy, cloudy days and nights. Somewhat eerie that it's a rainless night all of a sudden...<br/>
<br/>
Each puzzle consists of 144 pieces and takes about 30-60 minutes to complete. Featuring comic-style drawings, illustrative descriptions and a beautiful, soothing soundtrack, Pieces I introduces you to the universe of the Maskros Nebula and some iconic characters you will meet in later (narrative) owly crow games.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							March 18, 1920.<br>
I've finally checked into my cabin. It's cozy and nice enough. It's a little bumpy, but I think it's something I can get used to. Before boarding, I called my mom in Stowe to tell her that I'm out of touch for the next week - we're going out to sea. My mom wished me a good rest, although her voice gave away a slight anxiety. That's okay, I'm sure this trip will be good for me, and Mom will be patient. It is time to go to bed, I am tired.<br>
March 19, 1920.<br>
I slept just fine! I haven't had such a good night's sleep in ages! In the morning I went to Sherry's house to visit. She's in the room next door. Our cabins are exactly the same. Sherry made me happy. She gave me a lovely music box. Except I think I lost the key somewhere in her stateroom. We'll look for it after breakfast. Oh, I think it's time for breakfast in the banquet room. I'm starving, I must hurry!<br>
<br>
As you progress, you'll need to find keys and open locked doors. Solve puzzles and find passages. A first-person game with elements of horror. Explore the ship and its cabins, collect batteries for your flashlight. Ability to use the camera Solve puzzles. The darkness can conceal various secrets.<br>

- pleasant graphics;<br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This exhibition, brought to you by Atelier 58I0 in collaboration with designer Saul Kim, presents "Architecture Anomaly" in the playable virtual environment of Flappy Box. Navigate the world and space of Flappy Box, immersing yourself in an experience of a surreal world of architectural design and theory.  <br>
<br>
As the 17th installment in this series, the Flappy Box gallery invites you to navigate multiple levels, each dedicated to a distinct architectural concept. There is no specific objective; instead, the exhibition encourages you to enjoy, investigate, and understand these concepts at your own pace, fostering a sense of curiosity and leisure as you wander through Flappy Box. From spotting a life-size anomaly in the foggy distance to riding an elevator to the rooftop, this playable, digital exhibition challenges typical architectural design consumption. Within this virtual world and its galleries, you will gain unprecedented up-close, first-person POV access to 3-D digital models, drawings, and writings of the Architecture Anomaly series. <br>
<br>
This unique structure seamlessly blends conceptual elements with practical functionality. The exhibition focuses on three core concepts: Singularity, Anti-Conformity, and Momentum. These architectural ideas draw inspiration from speculative realism while reflecting the designer's evolving interests over time. The building itself stands as a tangible embodiment of all three concepts, inviting visitors to explore the intersection of creativity, curiosity, and design philosophy. <br>
<br>
<br/>
Atelier 58l0, established in 2022, is dedicated to challenging one’s relationship with art and architecture through exhibitions, filmmaking, architecture design, and virtual reality. The group consists of young designers with diverse architectural interests but shared goals.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Return to the intrigue of 'Mysteryville' in this amazing sequel ! <br>
Variations on the Hidden Object theme that will be encountered in 'Mysteryville 2' include searching a dimmed room with a flashlight, finding objects based on their silhouettes, collecting pairs of items and comparing two versions of the room side-by-side to note the differences between them.<br>
And of course you'll face the puzzles and different mini-games while going through main locations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Journalist Laura Winner just can't get enough of the odd little town of Mysteryville. After investigating the riddle of the missing cats in the first Mysteryville adventure, she returns for a visit and in spite of only wanting a relaxing vacation, finds herself sucked into another mystery. <br>
Laura comes to Mysteryville on the invitation of old acquaintance Bill Witowsky. However, she arrives in the town to find Bill missing and an art and jewelry auction about to take place organized by the town's new priest. Could Bill's disappearance and this auction, which is totally out of character for a small town like Mysteryville, be somehow tied together? It's up to Laura to find out, with your help of course.<br/>
Over the course of the game you'll get to interact with several of the town's inhabitants, including some new faces and some who will be familiar from the first game but have assumed new responsibilities in the town. Interacting with these characters - a few standouts being the creepy scientist and the slovenly small-town sheriff - are a big part of what helps to set Mysteryville 2 not just Hidden Object game but also a full-fledged quest.<br/>
<br/>
Search for and find all the clues to help you solve the case!<br/>
Pieces of paper become important evidence, and a mysterious anagram will help direct your investigation. The most important thing is not to waste any time, Mysteryville won’t be safe until you solve the case of Bill’s disappearance.<br/>
You're not just to searching rooms for random junk here, it feels like every hidden object search has a point to it and can be explained logically in the context of the story.<br/>
The characters and story that flesh out the experience make Mysteryville 2 a fun ride while it lasts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The game features:<br/>
<br/>
- An intriguing and interesting plot<br/>
- Colorful graphics<br/>
- Interesting and varied mini-games<br/>
- The atmosphere of a great detective story<br/>
