<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<br>
The first major story expansion is all about the Rogue Trader's voidship, the life of its crew, and the threats lurking in its holds. Dive into a new epic story integrated into the main narrative, battle new enemies, and recruit a new companion — a death cult assassin. Explore new decks of your voidship, unlock new upgrade options, and master the mechanics of void combat.

<br/>
<br/>
2. Lex Imperialis<br/>
(coming December 2024)<br/>

As the past of House von Valancius begins to present itself in a new light, the Rogue Trader faces difficult decisions that may affect the future of the entire Koronus Expanse.<br/>
Over the course of this story, you will get a chance to learn more about the collection of the Imperial Tithe, otherwise known as the Grand Harvesting. Interfere with this fundamental process of the Imperium at your own peril. Discover new areas, game mechanics, and archetypes — and of course, encounter new horrors of the Immaterium.<br/>

      <title>Blood West</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/header_alt_assets_1.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_steam_text_header.png?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in <strong>BLOOD WEST</strong>, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1702233135"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							It was once your grandfather’s pride-and-joy, but your family ranch has fallen on hard times and it’s up to you to turn things around. Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_DemolishGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Rebuild Your Ranch</h2><br/>The years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs you’ll need to keep them safe and secure.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_ChickensGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Look After Your Livestock</h2><br/>Grand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? That’ll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work.<br/><br/>Expand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_HuntingGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Head Out on the Hunt</h2><br/>There’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you aren’t the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood. Sometimes your steady hand and sharp eyes will also be needed back on the ranch to stop hungry wolves turning your off-grid dream into a nightmare.<br/><br/>Play the game PCGamesN calls "House Flipper meets Red Dead Redemption 2"!						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

The necromancer sends you to hell to find a part of his soul. On the journey you will have to solve puzzles, destroy zombies, demons and other creatures of evil. Some are easy to overcome head-on, others will have to look for a special approach.  <br>
Throughout the game, the type of puzzles will change. This is both the usual search for a path and the selection of code encrypted in the environment and the search for the right battle tactics.<br>
<br>
The game is designed for 2 hours of gameplay, but since it is a puzzle, the figure is very conditional.						</br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Software</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2><br/>If you've ever wanted to become a pilot in the U.S. military, start here! The U.S. military employs several tests to find the pilots with the best potential, including tests such as the U.S.A.F.'s Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS). Preparation is always the most important ingredient for success, and testing to become a pilot in the U.S. military is no exception. Use a keyboard and mouse or XBOX controller to practice... or, to get as close as possible to simulating the real TBAS, practice using the supported Thrustmaster T. Flight HOTAS kit! With enough practice, you can shine above all other candidates and secure your new career path in the skies.<br/><br/>This application contains a variety of features to prepare you for your aviation test, including three tests:<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION TEST</strong></h2><br/>This test measures and improves your ability to determine your aircraft's heading with nothing but your directional orientation shown on a map. In the test, a map is shown with your aircraft's heading depicted as an arrow. On the right side of the screen is a display showing a top-down visual of buildings from your perspective in the aircraft. Simply select the correct building when prompted based on the directional orientation shown on the map.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2673460/extras/DirectionalOrientation_GIF_v2.gif?t=1702236600"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>MULTITASKING TEST</strong></h2><br/>This test measures and improves your performance under stress, as well as your ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> MEMORY TEST: A code containing letters is shown briefly, and you must memorize the contents of the code before it disappears. Letters will appear in a box and you must select a "Check" or "X" button based on whether the letter that appears was in the code. You must make an entry before the time expires.<br/></li><li> MATH TEST: Addition and Subtraction problems will appear periodically. You must use the number buttons to enter in and submit the answer to the math problem shown before the time runs out.<br/></li><li> DIAL TEST: A dial on a gauge will periodically creep to the left or the right. Your job is to make sure that the dial stays in the green or yellow bands, and does not enter the red band.<br/></li><li> RADIO TEST (Speakers/Headphones Required): A voice will speak an audible command. You must remember your "Callsign" and click the proper "Radio Button" when your callsign is called and you are instructed to switch radios.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2673460/extras/Multitask_GIF_v3.gif?t=1702236600"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>AIRCRAFT TRACKING TEST</strong></h2><br/>This test measures and improves your ability to coordinate your hand and feet together to steer an aircraft toward desired targets. Contains two components that can be practiced either individually or simultaneously:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> PEDAL TRACKING TEST (Rudder Pedals Recommended): An aircraft silhouette travels horizontally from left to right on the bottom of the screen. Rudder pedals, arrow keyboard keys, or gamepad shoulder buttons are used to move a box over the aircraft silhouette. The goal is to raise your "Pedal Accuracy", which increases when the pedal box is over the aircraft silhouette.<br/></li><li> RETICLE TRACKING TEST (Flight Stick Recommended): An aircraft silhouette travels horizontally and vertically around the screen. A flight stick, "WASD" keyboard keys, or gamepad control stick are used to move the reticle on the screen over the aircraft silhouette. The goal is to raise your "Reticle Accuracy", which increases when the reticle is over the aircraft silhouette.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2673460/extras/AircraftTrack-Pedal_GIF_v3.gif?t=1702236600"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2673460/extras/AircraftTrack-Reticle_GIF_v3.gif?t=1702236600"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2673460/extras/AircraftTrack-ReticlePedal_GIF_v2.gif?t=1702236600"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ASSESSMENT MODE</strong></h2><br/>You can practice each test individually or you can try your hand at simulating a real test using the "Assessment Mode". In the Assessment Mode, the program scores your performance over each test and gives an approximated total score at the end of your assessment.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>QUALITY OF LIFE FEATURES</strong></h2><br/>This program contains a comprehensive suite of quality of life features that help you to prepare for your military aviation test.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> ADJUSTABLE DIFFICULTY: When practicing each test, you are given the option to adjust the difficulty of every aspect of each test.<br/></li><li> COMPREHENSIVE TUTORIALS: A comprehensive explanation of the mechanics of the test are provided, and are available for viewing throughout your practice session.<br/></li><li> PERFORMANCE HISTORY AND STATISTICS: From the menu, you can view your ASSESSMENT MODE performance history to see how your performance has improved over time.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></h2><br/>This program was built based off of publicly available information around U.S. military aviation aptitude tests, and using it to prepare does not compromise taking real U.S. military aviation aptitude tests (such as the TBAS).<br/><br/>While the program supports gamepad and select HOTAS controllers for the Aircraft Tracking test, a keyboard and mouse is required for all other tests.						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Welcome to the cold depths of ChiroTerra</strong></h2><br/>Leave the safety of the surface and venture into an unmarked cave alone.

You could bring chalk to mark your way through the cave, or a lighter that can pick up on the caves draft, or you could bring both if you have the enough space. Either way, wandering around aimlessly is a surefire way to freeze to death.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676470/extras/Drawing_GIF.gif?t=1702230967"><br/><br/>Lastly remember you're not alone in those dark, dank tunnels.

Just make sure you packed enough flares, or make sure you still have some bullets.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676470/extras/Flare_GIF.gif?t=1702230967"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Once your ball has been launched that's where the fun really starts! <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2524180/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__3_.gif?t=1702171478"><h2 class="bb_tag">Use Momentum</h2>Lots of momentum can be gained from the elements of each level. This momentum may be good at times, and others you might want to keep it slow and steady. There are a variety of ways to use and manipulate your momentum. Use it wisely and don't fly off into space! <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2524180/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif?t=1702171478"><h2 class="bb_tag">Slowdown</h2>Sometimes the ball is just going too quick to catch with your mouse! That's what the slowdown mechanic is for. At any time during play, slow down the game to a crawl in order to select the next object with ease, and manipulate it with precision. In order to keep the game fun, there's no limit to how often you can use this mechanic.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2524180/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__1_.gif?t=1702171478"><h2 class="bb_tag">Casual Gameplay</h2>Although some of the levels might pose a good challenge, this is a <strong>casual game</strong>. There is no pressure to complete every level and levels can be skipped at anytime via the level select. In addition to the ordinary level select there are also some extra-difficult bonus levels! Which can be unlocked after the ordinary levels for some additional challenge.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2524180/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif__2_.gif?t=1702171478"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FuebZsYtuFc" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1568620/extras/discord_small.gif?t=1702141991"> </img></a><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1568620/extras/aboutthegame_small.gif?t=1702141991"><br/>Do you hear the knocking in the night? The footsteps in the hallway? Do you see the figures moving in the shadows? The danger is hidden in plain sight.<br/>Above the natural, physical world we know lies the realm of metaphysics.<br/><br/>In MetaPhysical you can go hunting for these creatures with up to 5 other friends to put an end to their sinister activities!<br/>Whether an ordinary ghost or a demon, your task is to identify the rumbling creature and then finish it off.<br/>Or you can decide to challenge your friends and compete against them in the unique PvP mode! <br/>You have the choice to play as a creature and put the fear of death into your friends. Or you can play as a hunter and exorcise a ghost friend!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1568620/extras/hunt_small.gif?t=1702141991"><h2 class="bb_tag">The process of a hunt</h2>First equip yourself with a selection of helpful items before you go hunting. In the catalog you'll find all the items you need for your hunt: from EMF equipment to a carpet to camouflage the devil's traps. After you feel ready, you can look for the next mission in the newspaper. What creature it is, what difficulty level it is or whether it's a shy or aggressive one, you'll find out once you get to the haunted house and get to work.<br/><br/>Once you arrive at the haunted house, you can equip yourself with your equipment and start searching for the ghost's signs inside the house. To do this, you can consult your journal, finding the descriptions of all the sinister creatures. Once you have identified which creature it is, you can set out to defeat it. For example, if it's a normal ghost, you'll have to burn the human remains. On each map you will find a small graveyard with labeled graves. In the house you will find notes with possible names on them. If the majority of the notes point to a certain grave, you have to open it, pour gasoline and salt from your trunk on the bones and set them on fire. If the ghost bursts into flames, your job is done. If you run into trouble, you can leave the job at any time with your car.<br/><br/>The game uses random-based logic: ghost names, placement of notes, difficulty level or aggression of the creatures are reshaped at each level, so no game feels like the game before.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1568620/extras/features_small.gif?t=1702141991"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Identify the creature,</strong> in order to know how to act against it.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">FREEDOM IN CHAINS</h2><strong>Solomon's Link</strong> is a short (~20 minutes), story-driven, point-and-click <strong>demo</strong>, in which you serve unseen as both witness and guide to a pair of fugitives living out their first night of freedom after years behind bars. With two vastly different minds and two specialized sets of hands to work with, lead the escaped convicts through an industrial maze of fuse boxes and factory lines by leveraging each prisoner’s strengths to offset their partner’s mental and physical limits - not to mention, the limited reach of the chain that binds them together.<h2 class="bb_tag">PRISONERS’ DILEMMA</h2>In the process of their escape, jailbirds L.T. and R.T. broke free from their chain gang, but not from each other, leaving each of them bound to a criminal they hardly know, guilty of crimes they’d never learned. With no choice but to work together, yet no clue of each others’ intentions, each is left to weigh their mutual dependence for survival against the looming threat of betrayal, and balance the trust needed to move forward against the deceit necessary to stay safe. For better, or for worse - every word that is spoken, and every thought that goes unsaid, holds a chance to tip the scales.<h2 class="bb_tag">FLY ON THE WALL</h2>Justice is blind; you are more fortunate. Watch the world from above through the countless eyes of the factory’s security system, and hear the whispers of the concrete jungle with environmental sounds packed full of custom-made foley. Independently control R.T. and L.T. in both movement and conversations through simple, intuitive UI, stay immersed with menus designed to help you settle into the role of an investigative observer, and indulge in a fully-fledged original soundtrack to score it all.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOURCE CODE</h2>The source code for the game, together with all the assets, is available at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faarthificial-unity%2Ffoundations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/aarthificial-unity/foundations</a>.						</div></div>]]></description>
