<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							APR 07, 2060. It has been 40 years since the Technate has taken control of the world. In their arrogance and gluttony, they created a breed of intelligent pig. These pigs were trained from birth to self slaughter when they reach mature age. For a time, the Technocrats enjoyed their meat.<br/><br/>Then, a special boar was born -- one hellbent on destroying the Technate and putting the pigs at their rightful place atop the tower. His name was Rudy Hammon.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2266600/extras/W4.gif?t=1704421056"><br/><br/>Rudy must destroy the Technocratic infrastructure in his mission to dethrone Klaus Küller, the highest of the Technocrats. Along the way, he will face mutants, giant robots, and pork-crazed scientists who can't stop eating.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2266600/extras/W1.gif?t=1704421056"><br/><br/>The game plays like classics from the 80s and 90s such as Contra and Turrican. Find power-ups. Earn upgrades. Swim, shoot, and roll for pig freedom!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2266600/extras/W5.gif?t=1704421056"><br/><br/>Music by Ghostfeeder						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A small "horror" narrative game about isolation and depression.<br/><br/><i>My Friend The Spider</i> is a 10-15 minute walking simulator where the player finds<br/>themselves voluntarily locked in a room to escape and isolate due to their current emotional<br/>state and befriending a spider that grows in size with the story's progression.<br/><br/>I originally worked on the game for a month and a half around October 2022. My idea was to experiment with the Unity engine in order to practice my coding and get used to the engine. I had a short story in mind based on personal experiences and thought it would be a good idea to flesh it out as a narrative "game" instead. Everything bar the art assets was done by me. My wife helped with the voice acting (and emotional support).<br/><br/>After releasing it, it got quite a few number of views and plays - seeing people's comments about how they were moved by it, I realized a Steam release was in order. I took my time, but after sitting down and fixing some nasty bugs and others (white text on a white background? Really dude?) I am now happy to release it on Steam and let it be free with a nice, deserved final update. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it. Take care.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Prion: Infection</strong><br/>Prion is an FPS endless running game. Survive and try to catch your high score. Can you be successful? Ok then let's start running, welcome to the night. <br/>Don't forget that each level has its own scoreboard and there is also a global scoreboard.<br/><br/><strong>Story of Prion</strong><br/>In the year 2025, the global landscape was forever altered by a clandestine biological cataclysm. A mysterious outbreak, birthed from the enigmatic Prion Protein, once heralded as a scientific marvel, now manifested as a nightmarish force. Its insidious influence twisted the delicate balance of human brain functions, transforming ordinary individuals into ferocious, unpredictable mutants. The contagion, a relentless tide, surged across continents, ensnaring a vast swath of the world's population in its sinister grip.<br/>Amidst the chaos, you emerge as a vital cog in the last bastion of defense—the cornerstone of humanity's dwindling hope. A member of an elite military unit specially forged to confront this existential threat head-on. Tasked with the Herculean mission of halting the relentless outbreak and wresting control from the clutches of the infected mutants, your journey unfolds as an arduous odyssey.<br/>The ever-evolving mutations within the afflicted mutants pose an escalating challenge, pushing the boundaries of your training and resilience. As each passing day witnesses the mutants' aggression intensify, the weight of the world rests heavily on the shoulders of your specialized unit.<br/>[06:20]<br/>At the epicenter of this harrowing narrative stands Captain Alex Mercer, the indomitable protagonist of our tale. A seasoned and courageous soldier, Mercer is not merely a warrior; he is the embodiment of humanity's last stand. Having undergone rigorous training and uniquely fortified with immunity against the insidious Prion outbreak, he becomes the linchpin in the battle to salvage what remains of our world.<br/>Mercer's mission, noble and perilous, is not merely about survival; it is a quest to reclaim the soul of humanity. The stakes are nothing short of global salvation as he plunges into the heart of the mutated maelstrom, armed not only with weapons but with the knowledge that his actions will determine the course of the world's destiny.<br/>The journey is fraught with danger, and every step forward unravels more about the sinister nature of the Prion Protein. Scientific revelations intertwine with the visceral struggle for survival, creating a narrative tapestry that weaves through the remnants of once-thriving cities and the desolation left in the wake of the pandemic.<br/>As Captain Mercer, you navigate a treacherous path, encountering not only mutated adversaries but the moral quandaries that arise in a world teetering on the brink of oblivion. The decisions made in the crucible of chaos shape not only the destiny of the protagonist but the fate of the entire human race.<br/>In this immersive journey, the boundaries between heroism and despair blur, and the line between savior and survivor becomes increasingly thin. Captain Alex Mercer is not just a soldier; he is the embodiment of resilience, a beacon of hope in a world plunged into the abyss. The Prion outbreak may have initiated the apocalypse, but it is the actions of one man that will determine whether humanity rises from the ashes or succumbs to the darkness that now threatens to consume it.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Relive the golden days of adolescence, racing Micro Machines around tracks and bring impossible courses, stunts, and speed to life! Build tracks and blaze through circuits, perform stunts at max speed, crash elaborate sets for ultimate demolition and much more! <br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Track Building:</strong> Build incredible tracks using an intuitive, easy-to-use system to manipulate, switch, and place pieces. Build impossible courses, loop-de-loops, and stretches suspended in mid-air to achieve speeds no toy car has ever reached.<br/><br/><strong>Missions:</strong> Racing skill and creative course building mesh together in the campaign mode, where different objectives require picking the right car and course to get the job done! Some objectives require a fast car and a track built for speed, while others demand a monster truck that can rack up destruction points. <br/><br/><strong>Car Modification:</strong> Unlock and collect all types of vehicles, skins, and car parts for faster racing and bigger stunts. Modify cars base stats when you change out different car parts to adjust speed, acceleration, stunts , grip, and more!<br/><br/><strong>Mixed Reality:</strong> Build tracks anywhere! Send cars racing over sofas, on top of tables, and around sleepy pets. Create portals to send a vehicle racing through a wall in the kitchen and then fly out of another spot in the living room. Survive the gauntlet of traps, ghosts, and other dangerous objects spawned to stop the car in its tracks. The longer you survive and rack up points, the higher you will rank on the weekly Mixed Reality leaderboards!<br/><br/>MICRO MACHINES is a trademark of Hasbro and is used with permission. © 2023 Hasbro.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>The Christmas Demon Is HERE</strong><br/>Every Christmas she breaks out of her icy tomb and goes hunting for blood. Unfortunately, you're her only target.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2741950/extras/store1.gif?t=1704393351"><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><strong>The House</strong><br/>Stuck at home, use what you have around you to thrwart her attack! Perhaps you may lower the AC so low that she refreezes, or maybe you'll burn her to the ground. This map contains <strong>12</strong> unique endings! Some involve her death, some yours, and many more!<br/><br/>Once you've proven your skill, you can unlock the nightmare mode. A much more challenging house map with randomized enemies, a stronger AI, and so much more. The nightmare mode is challenging, but so are your treasures at the end of each round.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2741950/extras/store2.gif?t=1704393351"><br/><br/><strong>The School</strong><br/>Much like the house, this time you're stuck at school after hours when she attacks. Perhaps you'll hide in a locker or knock her with a dodgeball. Maybe you'll find a way to scare her to death. This map also contains brand new endings and a nightmare mode!<br/><br/>You can expect each round to last a few minutes, you'll be challenged with moving around, hunting her down, and solving puzzles all the way through.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2741950/extras/store3.gif?t=1704393351"><br/><br/>But thats not all...<br/><strong>Every Christmas a new map (and more) will be released FOR FREE! Stay tuned!</strong> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
