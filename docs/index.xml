You are Harry Herman, an employee of Delta Laboratories who researches interdimensional traveling. You had been participating in a project that was supposed to benefit all humanity, but something went wrong. Through the gameplay, you will solve various physics-based puzzles using an energy-manipulating weapon, travel across space and time to explore surrealistic universes and find out the dark truth about this project and your connection to it.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_gameplay.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Solve various puzzles and trick enemies using physics interactions and your special tool - the Portable Energy Manipulator. <br/><br/><strong>PHYSICS PUZZLES &amp; INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gameplay_physics.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>Many objects in the game can be picked up, brought somewhere, or manipulated in other ways. Whether it's a computer terminal, a box you can carry, or a simple mug on a table. Explore various interactive environments to find clues and return to the riddle with a solution, which in some cases may be several. Nothing was made for you to solve, there's no cube dispenser or an obvious exit door at the end. It's all for you to figure out.<br/><br/><strong>PORTABLE ENERGY MANIPULATOR</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/gif_photongun.gif?t=1701271403"><br/><br/>The device you carry throughout the game can absorb different energy types from the environment and use them to perform various tasks.<br/><br/>Absorbing energy from a particular source will give the gun its’ properties. The heat energy from fire and radiators will melt glass, security cameras can be blinded by a beam of light, and for powering generators, you can take hazardous radiation from toxic puddles scattered across Delta Labs facilities. And of course, you will make an encounter with the quantum entanglement energy - the mysterious power capable of opening rifts between worlds. <br/><br/>Apart from solving environmental puzzles, your device can also be used against various creatures you'll meet in parallel dimensions. Most of the time you can't defeat your enemies; instead, you can use the Manipulator to outsmart or suspend them. Some enemies can be frozen in place using the force field energy, while others are sensitive to light and can be distracted by shooting a beam at it in the distance. You will require more advanced strategies and combining various energy types to pass them.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_story.png?t=1701271403"><br/>You find yourself in one of Delta Labs' off-world research facilities in an unknown dimension that looks more like a crashing-down laboratory. Your old friends Eugene and Alex try to connect with you shortly, and with their help, you start a journey through various dimensions. You will learn different physics interactions and meet unusual creatures on your way home. Along this, you have to unveil the mysteries of this project and your past. <br/><br/>Experience a non-linear story where your choice always matters. Can you get to the bottom of this, or just try to escape? Who to listen? Who to trust? Which side will you take? And will you finally “break the Principle”? That depends entirely on you.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2155770/extras/art_setting.png?t=1701271403"><br/>Make your way back to Earth through mysterious parallel dimensions littered with puzzles and secrets, uncover mysterious connections between the worlds you visit, and reveal the dark truth about Delta Labs and your involvement with them.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>Once upon a time in a realm far, far away, everything was lush and green. The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br/><br/>“All is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come”, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape’s audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. “Time ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles… but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh—don’t come too close, you don’t want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?” The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. “Ah, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see… something… several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots – what could all this mean?”<br/><br/>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods. Stay tuned for the return of the Soothsaying Evil!</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1643310/extras/dungeons-4.gif?t=1701355158"><br/><br/>The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in <strong>Dungeons 4</strong> after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more.<br/><br/><strong>Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon</strong> to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. <strong>Gather your Evilness</strong> in new and dynamic ways <strong>and unleash it upon</strong> the lush green forests and plains of <strong>the Overworld</strong> to turn them over to the dark side.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/voyage.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><i>It is the Year of Our Lord 2754…<br/><br/>You will never feel the sun’s warmth under a blue sky, never hear the wind in the branches of a tree, and never swim in the ocean, all because you had the misfortune to be born on the Ship, chained to a fate you didn’t choose. You have never seen Earth and you’ll never see Proxima Centauri either. You’re doomed to live and die on the Ship in the name of the Mission, like your father before you, like his father before him.<br/><br/>The Ship is old. She had already been twenty years in service when she was rechristened Starfarer - a pretty name for a retrofitted interplanetary freighter. No one is certain the Ship will actually reach its destination, and nobody much cares, since no one alive now will live to see it. Might as well get on with your life and try to make the best of it.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/features_header.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Colony Ship is an isometric, party-based RPG inspired by Heinlein’s Orphans of the Sky. Your character's world is a “generation ship,” a massive spacecraft on a centuries long voyage to colonize a distant planet. The Ship's original government has been disbanded following a violent mutiny and you must negotiate a treacherous path among your fellow passengers and the contentious factions striving to dominate the Ship. Your choices will determine who your friends and enemies are.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/explore.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Pit.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Your adventure starts in the Pit - a sprawling heap of vacant cargo containers slowly getting filled up with those who couldn't afford to stay in the Habitat or needed to get away from its bosses and factions. Out here, folks live free and die fast...<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>You open your eyes to a grey hull-metal ceiling, one panel of which flickers yellow, indicating dayshift. You overslept, not that it matters. With a grunt you roll off your stained mattress and open the "window" to let some fresh air in. Like everything else around here, fresh is relative. The Ship does its best to recycle air and water, but cargo holds aren’t high on Her priority list. You breathe in metal and burning oil and look up. Four of the bridge's six projectors are still operational, shining dully down on the container towers of Cargo Hold 3, better known as the Pit, the Free City.<br/><br/>Calling the Pit a city is a bit of a stretch, but so is calling this reddish-brown liquid water. You've read that water is supposed to be clear and cities are supposed to be big, but no ship-born has ever seen either. Maybe in another hundred years water will look and taste like oil and people will be talking about the good old days when it was the color of rust and tasted refreshingly bitter and tangy. That's the kind of optimism that keeps you going.<br/><br/>The elevator crawls up a groove in the cargo hold's wall like a black steel bug that's worn a path traveling to the bridge and back. It’s time to get up there and earn a few credits, but first you need a drink.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Hydroponics.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Once tasked with adapting Terran plants and grasses to the alien environment of Proxima Centauri, Hydroponics was abandoned during the Mutiny. Quickly overwhelmed by out-of-control mutant vegetation, it more closely resembles deep jungle than a research complex. In addition to the abnormal plants, oversized pest control species –bioengineered to safeguard the colony's farmlands– are also on hand to punish the careless.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>Plants were sacred to the Founding Fathers. They represented our connection to Mother Earth, our sustenance, and our future. Picture rippling fields of wheat, rye, and barley to the horizon, mighty oaks and cedars, children eating apples right from the tree. That was the vision for Proxima.<br/><br/>But they didn't anticipate how many seedlings would fail in the Ship's simulated environments. And unless they found a way to make good those losses, it would be catastrophic. Alien fauna and poor soil were deemed the biggest threats, so they matched the most important plant species with customized, symbiont fungi. The latter were meant to act as pest killers. Unfortunately, the fungus did its job a little too well. We’re the pests now.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Habitat.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Before the Mutiny, the rooftops of the Habitat supported a sprawling amusement park. There, the people of the Ship could experience at least a few of the novelties they would never enjoy on Earth or Proxima: walk barefoot on real green grass – courtesy of Hydroponics – or soft, red-tinted 'Proxima' sand; sit under tall, artificial trees; and watch the sunrise on gigantic screens suspended all around. This last was said to be indistinguishable from the real thing, not that anyone aboard had ever seen it.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the three remaining rooftops are heavily fortified platforms, patrolled by armed guards. The sky-screens went dark long ago, a frivolous luxury in a decaying world. The grass underfoot and simulations of golden fields have likewise vanished, replaced by watchtowers and checkpoints. With enemies on all sides, cheap entertainment is a useless distraction from reality and its harsh demands.<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Mixed.gif?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Armory - Among the stars, the children of Earth wish most of all for peace. Nevertheless, the wise prepare for every eventuality – we should not survive long without the means to protect our territory and interests, with violence if every other method is exhausted. To that end, the Ship launched with a wide assortment of peacekeeping weapons and armaments, most of it looted and spent during the Mutiny and the hundred lesser skirmishes that followed.<br/><br/>Mission Control - The century-old wreckage of the Ship Authority government complex that once controlled every aspect of life on the Ship. Now scavengers infest this ancient seat of power, a grim reminder that nothing lasts.<br/><br/>The Shuttle Bay - Noah relied on doves to find a landing place, the Ship carried twelve survey shuttles for that same purpose. Even though the Shuttle Bay survived the Mutiny intact, it was looted in the interim, the life support systems and emergency supplies stripped, and the shuttle interiors used by generations of squatters. <br/><br/>The Factory - An abandoned industrial complex that once worked 'round the clock to produce tools for the Ship and the future colony. Why squander your precious shekels on second-hand Earth machinery, when your captive workforce will have three hundred years to manufacture everything you need?<br/><br/>And many others.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/gain.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Combat.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>Combat is difficult. You’ll be outnumbered and outgunned, so you’ll have to figure out how to even the odds or avoid fights you can't win. There are 3 main factors determining the difficulty of any combat encounter and your character's life expectancy: Accuracy, Evasion, Damage (both dealt and taken). To succeed in combat, you must learn to control these factors. <br/><br/>Accuracy = 50 + bonuses from (stat + skill + feat + implant + helmet/goggles + weapon). You can easily neglect a couple of items from this list and still be a competent fighter, meaning you don't need to min/max your stats because it's only 1 item out of 6. The attacker's accuracy is further modified by the attack type (different attacks have different pros and cons), the weapon's gun's effective range, and inflicted penalties.<br/><br/>Evasion = bonuses from (stat + skill + feat + implant + armor handling – armor penalty). The defender's evasion is further modifier by cover (the exact bonus depends on the angle), gadget bonus (i.e., using a Disruptor Field), and smoke/spore cloud (smoke grenades and certain critters). More detailed information can be found on the character and inventory screens (which show your accuracy and evasion), and in combat, where you can press ALT when targeting while targeting to learn what is affecting the accuracy of a particular attack.<br/><br/>The damage depends on both the weapon and the target's defense. Incoming damage is reduced by damage resistance (feat + implants + armor) and energy shield (gadget and/or energy armor). Weapons with good penetration and/or aimed attacks can reduce enemy's damage resistance, dealing more damage.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Stealth.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>When you enter the stealth mode all tiles are automatically assigned detection values, determined by the distance from the guards, which way they're facing, their Perception, and thermal vision gear, if any. Green - safe (you remain undetected), yellow - risky (if you end your turn there, you'll be spotted), red - instant discovery. High sneaking ability (modified by skill, feats, gear) turns more tiles green and opens up more options, whereas a low level thief might see nothing but yellow and red tiles. <br/><br/>Each step and action (lockpicking, climbing, using computers, killing guards in stealth mode, etc) generates noise. Not a whole lot of noise to instantly alert the guards the moment you do something, but enough to add up over time and raise the guards' suspicions. The higher the guards' Perception, the faster the alert bar is filled. An alerted guard turns towards the last noise generated, meaning a lot of safe tiles will turn red and if you're in the line of vision you'll be instantly discovered. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/Dialogue.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>If fighting isn't you thing, you can avoid ALL combat by relying on speech skills: Persuasion, Streetwise, and Impersonate. Not every solution is in your face, but it is there. We check stats, skills, reputation, deeds, and track your choices to deliver appropriate consequences. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/friends.png?t=1701168231"><br/>Ten party members (max party size is 4) and well over a hundred different characters, some less friendly than others. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/001.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/002.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/003.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/005.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/008.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/007.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/015.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/006.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/harbinger.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/009.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/012.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/010.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/016.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/013.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/004.jpg?t=1701168231"> <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/017.jpg?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><i>Lord's Mercy was her given name. Though he wasn't a priest, her father had called himself a Man of Scripture, and never tired of reminding his only child of God's wrath, His vengeance, His untiring thirst for retribution. If that’s what her name meant, Mercy did her best to live up to it.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><i>"Are you now?" Bartholomew looks at you with interest. "I assume you were on your way to the Habitat, but now you're stuck here...  Your odds aren't looking good, my friend,” he gives you a salesman's smile. “Attacking the Black Hand's stronghold is suicide, with or without our help. If Stanton loses...” He makes a pause, letting you work it out on your own.</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><i>“You may address me as Harbinger. I no longer have a name." The bitterness in her voice is unmistakable. She must not have been doing this Harbinger thing for long. One of the guards removes his helmet to reveal an oddly leathery face with deep-sunk eyes and a lipless mouth. He grins as he savors your discomfort.<br/><br/>“I wonder if the Neanderthals were as shocked by your outlandish appearance,” the woman says. “I wonder if they foresaw their own doom.”</i><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/join.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>A generation ship is a perfect ant-farm where different societies can coexist within a limited space, influencing and affecting each others' development while fighting for that limited space, which adds 'the end justifies the means' pressure. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/protector.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Protectors' one truth is the Mission, and the sole way to ensure successful completion of the Mission is to follow the Old Ways. The ways of the fathers, forefathers, and Founding Fathers are together the beam upon which the Ship travels to our ultimate destination. The mutiny, which through their steadfast and timely intervention was thankfully aborted, was the ultimate betrayal of the Old Ways, of everyone who had come before, the nullification of every sacrifice and every life dedicated to the Mission.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/brotherhood.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>The Brotherhood was formed to liberate the people from the iron shackles of the Ship Authority. Though their first sally -which the fossils of the old world denigrate with the term "mutiny"- failed to completely achieve this aim, the Brotherhood was successful in establishing themselves as a power to be reckoned with. The Brotherhood's initially pure goal, to free the enslaved wherever they may be, has unfortunately been sullied by the practical concerns of democracy. To bring freedom to the Ship entire must involve war, and no war may be won without sacrifice, nor may battles be managed by committee.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/church.png?t=1701168231"><br/><br/>As inevitably happens in dark and challenging times, some citizens turn to God for reassurance, the promise of an end to pain and hunger. Or failing an end, at least a purpose. The Church of the Elect rejected both the Protectors of the Mission and the Brotherhood of Liberty as worldly fools distracted by politics and their own egos. Teaching their adherents that they were chosen by God, the Church frames the journey of the Ship as a centuries-long test of faith. When the Ship arrives at her destination, Judgment Day awaits every citizen. The righteous will be welcomed into the Promised Land of Proxima Centauri, while the unrepentant will be returned to the Hell from which we fled - Earth - to suffer for all eternity.<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"/><br/>Plus lesser factions and groups: People of the Covenant (the mutants), the House of Ecclesiastes, formerly known as ECLSS - the Environmental Control and Life Support System, the Pit's Freemen, Thy Brother's Keepers, the Grangers, Jackson's Riflemen, and more!<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/648410/extras/123.png?t=1701168231"/> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Ace Racers SP</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2685150/Ace_Racers_SP/?snr=1_239_new__tab-AllNewReleases</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2685150/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Ace Racers SP is designed to be an FPV drone racing simulator for space drones. The purpose of the project was to make a platform for players to create and share unlimited obstacles and maneuvering challenges for the practice of thrust physics vehicles, primarily a 6axis RCS spaceship. Also available in game is a "lunar lander" style vehicle, and a "forward only" style vehicle (which only moves forward), as well as a 6axis space vehicle purpose built for pushing freight around like a space barge. <br>
<br>
Although formatted with many similarities to a racing game, and titled as a racing game, the primary function of the game is to create courses and obstacle arrangements for the purpose of expanding the available unique maneuvers to practice for the vehicle type. It is possible to export and import saved courses/obstacle arrangements, and the end-goal of the project is to collect an ever increasing database of course material for players to sift through and expand their capabilities with the sticks. <br>
<br>
It IS possible to "race" yourself, although the course order and timing system are intended not for the purpose of player competition, but rather for the purpose of making it easier to share very specific arrangements/courses. By being able to create a course which highlights the next checkpoint it is possible to make a course, save the course order, and for another player to then "race" the course, without having to find a map or video instruction on the specific pattern of checkpoints. The course will simply tell you where to go next and when you are ready to fly without the racing system you can, or you can choose to continue to use the racing system in order to see your lap-times and compare them with your previous laps. <br>
<br>
This game was not designed with keyboard and mouse in mind, and instead was originally conceived as a way to make use of my own home-made 6axis controller. It is BEST played with some form of "space game rig" , for example a 6axis hotas, space mouse, or for some people a gamepad is adequate, if not a bit unintuitive for 6axis. The best "lunar lander" flight performance I personally have ever seen posted on the internet, was in the classic game "Lunar Flight" and was performed by a player claiming to have flown ONLY using keyboard (no mouse), and therefore the default control configuration for my game is also keyboard-only, as although I prefer my 4joystick gamepad , I am confident that keyboard-only is simply the superior choice over keyboard and mouse. This game uses Rewired so virtually any controller can be set up/configured by the player, although most/all should not be set up by default.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							What games does your dad play - It is a management game with the theme of running a game center, and players can replay a variety of stalls, electronic games, etc. from the 80s, 90s, and even 2000s.<br>
<br>
Operating a Game Center:<br>
Each game also requires a certain amount of funds and specific game tickets to build, and some also require employees to operate, so some need to increase manpower appropriately. In addition, all games also need maintenance and the center needs to be cleaned otherwise there will be fewer customers. You can also hire receptionists to increase the number of customers.<br>
<br>
Mini-games:<br>
In addition, every game in the game can also be played. Players only need to go to the game and press "E" to enter the mini-game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Three more games were added to the first release:<br/>
1. Alien race - A shooting game where players avoid bullets while shooting alien creatures.<br/>
2. City ​​defense tower - A city defense game where players use two turrets to shoot down missiles all over the sky to defend the city.<br/>
3. Happy Block - An intellectual game where players need to put the scattered numbers in order.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							[Game Description]<br/>This content allows players to choose whether a young man living in Korea shaves his head through video. Players can decide whether to shave their heads or not.<br/><br/>[Experience and Motivation]<br/>Created to inspire players to live a more challenging life by gaining courage and motivation from watching a young man actually shaving his head.<br/><br/>[Story]<br/>Hello! I'm not originally a game developer.<br/><br/>I've been an inventor since I was in the 2nd year of middle school.<br/><br/>I'm now 26 years old.<br/><br/>I have a strong interest in invention and love to challenge new things, so I started attending an invention class since the 2nd year of middle school.<br/><br/>Although I was very interested in invention during middle school, I didn't consider it as my major.<br/><br/>During that time, I participated in my first invention competition and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment and presenting my ideas to others.<br/><br/>Later, I found out about the existence of specialized invention high schools, and I decided to attend one.<br/><br/>After entering high school, I received over 20 awards in invention competitions and applied for and registered 6 patents, which inspired me to start a business based on my inventions.<br/><br/>However, by the time I was in my senior year of high school, I had only saved 3 million won (approximately $2,500), and the cost of making molds was too expensive, so I had to give up.<br/><br/>As I contemplated my next steps, I realized that instead of needing a lot of money to start a business, I could start a business by investing my time.<br/><br/>I came up with the idea of creating content. So, I decided to major in game development at a university.<br/><br/>Over the next 4 years, I focused on game development, and starting from my 2nd and 3rd year, I gradually created and released games, similar to a lean startup.<br/><br/>By the time I was in my 4th year, I created and released a game called 'Blue Tricks,' which I had crowdfunded the previous year.<br/><br/>However, the results were not as good as I had hoped, but I saw it as a part of the journey towards success and continued to plan and develop games consistently.<br/><br/>I was fortunate to find team members who shared my vision in a relatively short amount of time.<br/><br/>In April of 23, we acquired our first office, and 5 months have passed since then.<br/><br/>As time goes on, it feels like we are walking down a dimly lit path, but we keep challenging ourselves and creating every day.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this, I thought of a game idea that would relieve my frustration and capture people's attention.<br/><br/>That idea was the buzz cut simulation. The reasons are:<br/><br/>1. Anyone can get a buzz cut, but people find it difficult and don't like it.<br/><br/>2. I think people will be interested if they get a buzz cut.<br/><br/>3. I believe it's the quickest way to raise funds to support my business.<br/><br/>However, the results are unknown, so I decided to create the game with a mindset of trying it out and taking the challenge."""						</div></div>]]></description>

It's entirely text-based, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Play as male, female, or nonbinary.

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2595210/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle for Madrid - SGS Battle Series</h2><br/><strong>SGS Battle for Madrid</strong> is the second game of our new SGS Battle Series, covering intense fights and battles in well know (or not) small but fighting-heavy locations ; ‘grand tactical’ scale for regiment, battalion, company and even platoon-size units (depending on the games) and game turns which represent a very short real period of time (one or two days, half a day, a few hours…).<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2595210/extras/Sides_MAD.png?t=1701351035"><br/><br/>One of the many particularities of the Battle series compared to other SGS relates to a unit activation system which means that not all units will necessarily be able to move and fight in a turn. This will only be possible for them if they have been activated. And depending on the battles or the episodes during them, the activation limits will be more or less important.<br/>Madrid is emblematic of the Spanish Civil War, one of the tensest battles of this conflict which could have ended the war earlier for the Nationalists if they had won it. In this game, you can play both sides, Nationalist or Republican; against another player in PBEM or in hot seat, against AI.<br/><br/><strong>Scale</strong><br/>In this specific game, units are mostly battalion-size. The fighting takes place in the hills and plains west and south of the Spanish capital, and on the immediate outskirts of the city. Some “off map boxes” are also integrated to represent more distant areas (where close strategic points such as air bases are located). <br/>Each turn is the equivalent of three days.<br/>The game elements consist mainly of ground units and some air units.  There are many types of troops and vehicles as were present there by the end of 1936. The political aspects of the battle are handled by events and cards.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2595210/extras/Madrid_Deco1.png?t=1701351035"><br/><br/><strong>SGS Battle for Madrid</strong> covers the period from 9 October 1936 till 15 January 1937, where the direct assault was active, before the battle turned to a distant siege situation till the later fall of the city in 1939. <br/>At the beginning of the battle, there are few troops on both sides and the quality and power advantage is clearly in favor of the Nationalists. However, time plays for the Republican, as they get more and more unit as days are passing, allowing them to strengthen the defenses and hold the core of the city safe. <br/>The game will contain a grand campaign scenario covering the battle from October until January, as well as other (intermediate or shorter – see below) scenarios based on different starting days or limited to specific areas (Jarama, the University, etc…) of the battle.<br/>We plan to also provide the players with interesting options to explore potential what-if situations.<br/>The player will also find in the game historical events. <br/><br/>Those can be strictly historical or random depending on their nature, and/or depending on the game setting (historical scenario or what if). A more efficient Republican Command? More troops for the Nationalists? Soviet intervention or Axis support is more, or less, present?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							MalovMetaArt is a metaverse of world art, a digital museum that allows you to view the digital twins of world masterpieces that are identical to their physical counterparts.<br>
<br>
The key distinction among MalovMetaArt and similar projects is the 100% accurate replication of artworks. Using photogrammetry and laser scanning techniques, we have created a way to create precise digital twins of the masterpieces of world art you see in the app. You can even touch, zoom and examine the artworks from all sides. In virtual space, you can hold an item (which is not allowed in a real museum) or get up close to unique paintings, so close that they can see the texture of each touch of the genius’s brush.<br>
<br>
Non-traditional exhibition galleries are another feature of MalovMetaArt. Here you may admire glass artworks exhibited under the starry sky of faraway planets, as well as masterpieces of painting in a subway hall of mid-20th century.<br>
<br>
Many of us don't frequently visit regular museums. So, give a go to a virtual one. You'll like it. Furthermore, MalovMetaArt Metaverse is better and more convenient than a traditional museum in many aspects.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Hand In Hand is a 2D split screen puzzle platformer, where the player can control two characters at once, or two players can play in co-op mode on one device.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>A TOUCHING STORY</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209510/extras/History.gif?t=1701341865"><br/>Two soulmates live in a fairytale world. But when evil came to their world, they lost each other. Now both of them need to head towards each other, facing many difficulties and dangers along  the way. And only by finding a fragile connection between one another and going hand in hand will they be able to defeat evil and meet again. It's a story about how we can help one another even when you're apart, and be far from one another even when you're nearby. It's a story about the importance of relationships and mutual support. But every story has an even deeper meaning...<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SPLIT SCREEN</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209510/extras/SplitScreen.gif?t=1701341865"><br/>The game works in splitscreen mode, with one character on each screen in their respective locations. The game has two modes. The first is single-player mode, where one player simultaneously controls both characters with one joystick. In this mode, the player must demonstrate sophisticated controller skills. The second is local co-op mode, where two players control the characters using two joysticks. Here, both players control their respective characters. Each mode has its advantages. Single-player mode requires you to show great dexterity and reaction speed, and co-op mode allows you to feel the joy of playing the game with your family or friend. Try both game modes, we hope you'll like it and enjoy completing it.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH AND HELP EACH OTHER</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209510/extras/Interaction.gif?t=1701341865"><br/>Each character has their own part of the level in a common location. However, some parts of the level are interconnected. This means that the characters can interact and help each other complete the level. Characters can move keys and objects from one part of the screen to another, and most puzzles are need to be solved by both characters working together, connecting parts of the screen and solving puzzles together.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>EPIC BOSSES</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209510/extras/Boss.gif?t=1701341865"><br/>The game has epic boss battles. Each boss represents the world of shadows that has invaded this fairytale forest and wants to plunge all the inhabitants of this fairytale world into the horror of eternal darkness. Our brave heroes, Lina and Minho, must defeat each of the bosses so that peace and prosperity will once again reign in the fairy forest. Boss battles take place without splitscreen, and are designed to be played by just one of the characters, so each character must defeat their evil shadow bosses.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>PUZZLES</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1209510/extras/LightPuzzle.gif?t=1701341865"><br/>On their way through the collapsing fairy-tale world, the characters will constantly encounter various puzzles like closed doors, laser beams with reflectors, ancient mechanisms and ruins, labyrinths, and caves full of dangers. Our heroes will be able to overcome all difficulties, but each will have to make every effort to pass these trials and help their companion.						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>The first alien beings did not fall from heaven. <br/><br/>They come from beneath the ground.<br/><br/>They destroyed everything on the earth on their first appearance.</strong><br/><br/><br/><i>THE HIGHRISE</i> is a first-person survival game set in a high-rise building that has been sealed off by an alien monster invasion. Gather resources to make fighting weapons and survival tools. You must find and send a rescue signal at the end of your desperate survival.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Feel the void and abandoned highrise building</strong></h2><br/>Prior to this apocalyptic era, facilities such as shopping malls, offices, and residences, which were previously crowded with people, were very familiar and friendly spaces to us. But, now, they will inspire fear in a sense of emptiness and heterogeneity that no one can find. Furthermore, it is a space created by inspiring real skyscrapers, and the space that is vacated or omitted has been minimized. Players will feel that every floor and facility in the building will have the appearance of a very real space.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SHHH! Beware of noise caused by carelessness.</strong></h2><br/>The monster sniffers responsible for humanity's extinction have a highly developed sense of hearing and smell. They can detect even the smallest movements, coughs, and gurgling sounds from your stomach. Moreover, if there is a loud noise, such as glass breaking or falling from a great height, the sniffers will rush to the player.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GO DOWN AND DOWN! Find out more and better resources.</strong></h2><br/>To avoid the monster sniffers, the last survivor stayed near the top floor of a building. The player used to be a linker, connecting these survivors to the food court in the building's basement. Use this knowledge to your advantage. The lower floors you go, the more resources you have and the more efficient you are. However, as they get closer to the ground, the monsters become more powerful and the number of monsters increases. But you never know; you may find any hints to help you escape from the downstairs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">KEY FEATURES</h2></strong><br/><br/>* Hunger and thirst must be controlled. However, be cautious of food poisoning. Food poisoning survivors are likely to be pursued by sniffers.<br/><br/>* You can obtain resources by destroying most of the building's furniture. For a much more efficient acquisition, use tools that are specific to the material of each piece of furniture. <br/><br/>* Make and install the tools required for survival. You can carry a still to purify dirty water, a cooktop to boil food, and a workbench to craft survival tools.<br/><br/>* You can avoid monsters by sneaking between them, but you can also create weapons to fight them. Crafting each appropriate tool and weapon for combat and infiltration allows you to work more efficiently. <br/><br/>* A ventilation system connects all of the building's floors and rooms. This is the only safe zone from the group of monsters, and it is entirely up to the player. Remember the layout and flow of this area.<br/><br/>* There are a total of 6 playable characters, each with different stats and passive skills.<br/><br/>* Single-player and multiplayer for up to 4 players (up to 8 players in custom mode) are available. In multiplayer, there will be balance adjustments based on the number of players.<br/><br/>* There will be Sandbox mode, Survival mode, and Custom mode. In Sandbox mode, infinite lives are guaranteed, and there will be resource respawns. However, in Survival mode, you can experience the true challenge of the game with limited resources and a one-time life. In Custom mode, you can configure various options according to the difficulty level you desire.						</div></div>]]></description>
