<h2>About This Content</h2>
							The Survivors are desperate to hunt vampires, but are running out of places to look. Only one option remains: Be the bullet hell... in space! <br/><br/>Gather your most trusted Crewmates, prepare to eject the Impostors, and try to survive while mowing down thousands of extra-terrestrial foes in this expansion for Vampire Survivors. Turn classic Among Us tasks into outrageous weapons, upgrading your abilities after every roguelite run to overcome impossible odds with ease. Be alert to subterfuge as you explore the vast weirdness of the Polus Replica and keep your wits about you, as suspicious eyes are always watching üëÄ.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features <strong>20-in-game only</strong> unlocks, no Steam achievements.

Dino is a jack-of-all-trades who boosts stats whenever a task is completed (i.e. when you level up a weapon). <br/><br/>Engineer Gino - Few Crewmates come as close to truly competent task-work as Gino, who offers a selection of passive weapons from their toolbox every few levels. <br/><br/>Ghost Lino - Good Crewmates don't let a silly thing like death get in the way of their tasks. Lino can float through walls at will and can't be hurt, but can't deal damage either... what could be the goal of such suspicious game design?! <br/><br/>Shapeshifter Nino - Look at this bean! They can do all kinds of... wait, where did they go? And where did this snowman come from? Oh well, I'm sure you'll figure it out. <br/><br/>Guardian Pina - Everyone needs an angel on their shoulder. Pina isn't just there for moral support, though - they boost the defences of all nearby allies, and they love taking out the garbage. <br/><br/>Impostor Rina - A fellow Crewmate that is in no way some kind of duplicitous, well-disguised killer. One hundred percent all-natural-bean, right here. Nothing to see or think about. <br/><br/>Scientist Mina - Mina's scientific skill is matched only by their intense clumsiness. Thankfully, dropping potentially hazardous chemicals has a major upside when you're besieged by extra-terrestrial monsters. <br/><br/>Horse - It's a horse. Neigh, etc. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Weapons_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/WeaponIcons.png?t=1702898514"><br/>Transform your tasks into powerful weapons to defend yourself from Impostors, Shapeshifters, and all manner of extra-terrestrial weirdos. Blast away baddies with the supermassive sound waves of your Report! weapon, slice angry aliens in half with Lucky Swipe, and drop duplicitous foes to their doom with Just Vent. Lonely Survivors should seek out Mini Crewmates to empower their Task-based weaponry (or just for general companionship). <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Stage_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/>Polus Replica - an eerily accurate replica of the scientific base on Polus. This planet is packed with bizarre biomes ripe for exploration by Survivors and Crewmates, with tasks and treasure chests galore. Unfortunately, its also accidentally being invaded by your average space dwellers, like aliens, robots, and ducks. Expect the unexpected and do NOT trust the bins. Never trust the bins. Or the chicken nuggets. In fact, it's a good idea to remain alert at all times and not trust anything. <br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/StageMap.png?t=1702898514"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2690330/extras/1_Tracks_ENG.png?t=1702898514"><br/>‚ô´ Emergency Meeting<br/>‚ô´ Hide and Survive<br/>‚ô´ No Ducks Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Aliens Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Ghosts Among Us<br/>‚ô´ No Vampires Among Us						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sue√±os ‚Äì The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sue√±os area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sue√±os is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. ‚ÄúThe city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,‚Äù states Chief Galo √Ålvarez. ‚ÄúIn a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.‚Äù <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sue√±os, Chief √Ålvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‚ÄòJudge‚Äô Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
‚ÄúThis assignment is not for the faint of heart,‚Äù comments Commander Beaumont, ‚ÄúExtremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography‚Ä¶ the world of policing in Los Sue√±os is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn‚Äôt necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.‚Äù <br>
<br>
The Los Sue√±os Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù Beaumont‚Äôs updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sue√±os or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we‚Äôve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team‚Äôs mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn‚Äôt limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you‚Äôll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy ‚Äì a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end ‚Äì but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1702218649"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1702218649"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You Got Crabs is a relaxing crab simulator that allows you to watch, and care for, crabs in different settings.<br>
<br>
Crabs<br>
Crabs are simple creatures. They require food and space to live, but not much else. They will roam around, eat plants or animals and breed with each other. Watch them grow and live their lives, or intervene with toys and new foods which can be found in crates that wash ashore.<br>
<br>
Evolution<br>
The crabs will evolve and their changes will affect their life cycles. The evolutionary processes are displayed by the color of the crab. A crab that has more red or orange will likely be able to handle heat better than a blue crab, for example. These traits are passed on to offspring, so they are able to adapt over time to changing environments. In the game, the player is able to modify the environments to force these changes.<br>
<br/>
Food<br/>
These particular crabs love to eat plants, particularly their specially formulated berries, but over time they may develop a taste for meat. If they do they will feast on the bodies of other dead crabs. If they never reach cannibalism, however, they may begin nibbling on the stalks that grow their special berries to gain extra nutrients. Be careful that they don't destroy the crop.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

You command a group of one to six characters with such roles as monk, priest, wizard, ranger, thief, or fighter. Your companions need not be human; they may be gnomes, elves, orcs, or lizardmen ‚Äî just to name a few exotic races.<br/>With this motley crew, you search the lands for the Nine Rings to help you wipe out the scourge of Gelnor ‚Äî the Dark Lord and his evil minions. You'll map out new terrain, explore maze-like dungeons, solve puzzles, learn spells, gain experience, and battle countless monsters.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You're the best they've got.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, your latest hot-dog stunt did not impress the base commander. No sense of humor. So here you are, patrolling a backwater outpost where the only real danger is the food.<br>
<br>
Bored to death, you notice that the stars around you are moving. And then it hits you like a bucket of ice water - those are definitely not stars, they're TOG fighters! Maybe you shouldn't have wished so hard for some action...<br>
<br>
Get ready for the dogfight of your life! Command a squadron of Renegade fighters against an overwhelming Terran Overlord Government invasion force. Fly your choice of futuristic ships - from the speedy Cheetah and elusive Space Gull to the exotic Fluttering Petal and the massive Pegasus.  It's so intensely real, you'll be sweating bullets!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Enter the decrepit lair of the Dark Mother</strong>, the powerful demon that rules the underworld. Prove yourself a worthy Dungeon Lord by satiating her endless hunger for domination, conquest, and the ultimate eradication of the human race. It is up to you to lead your minions to victory through an array of logistical challenges and brutal skirmishes.<br/><br/>As Dungeon Lord, your key challenge is to create strong production chains that process the natural underground resources like ore, roots, and coal into useful materials for building rooms and furniture, crafting weapons and armour, or feeding the dark mother for valuable rewards. Cultivate the rich subterranean soil to grow the starchy antroot, used to bake bread and brew beer, and hunt rats and fish for protein to be cooked and served in your bar rooms.<br/><br/>As more minions join your fray, whether through force or as an offering from the Dark Mother, you must tend to their different needs for food, drinks, relaxation, training and task management. After all, even imps require work-life balance. A healthy and well-rested army is key to defeating your enemies and expanding your base.<br/><br/>Keeping your base safe from aggressive creatures, monsters and crusading humans is a challenge best met with strong defences, traps, and a lot of sharp blades. Train your forces, equip them with powerful gear, and send them to the surface world to raid and pillage the humans. Use magic spells to reveal hidden areas, slow your enemies, smite them with lightning, or even turn them against each other.<br/><br/>Dwelvers features a plethora of systems and gameplay mechanics:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Unique multi-layered dungeon, allowing you to dig and build vertically.<br/></li><li>Near-infinite combinations of randomly generated worlds for near-infinite entertainment, no two levels are the same.<br/></li><li>A rich, narrated campaign that eases you into each mechanic and lets you destroy your first human empire.<br/></li><li>Free-form room building, you decide the shape, size and layout of every room without presets.<br/></li><li>AI-controlled creatures, each with their own needs, skills and equipment.<br/></li><li>Elaborate production chains that turn natural resources into tools of conquest in the hands of your minions.<br/></li><li>Crafting systems, letting you manufacture, loot, and equip powerful weapons and armour for your minions.<br/></li><li>Parallel worlds, while your base of operations are below ground, you will pay regular visits to the surface world to raid and destroy human villages.<br/></li><li>Tower-defence style traps and cannons to protect your base from invaders.<br/></li><li>Trading system that allows you to balance your stockpiles with off-map settlements by capturing portals.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/276870/extras/DwelversStoreCyc.png?t=1702995116"> </img></div></div>]]></description>
