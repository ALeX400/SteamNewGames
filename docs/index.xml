<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Header.png?t=1710341900"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body0_2.png?t=1710341900"><br/>Experience the ultimate blend of strategy and intrigue as you navigate the treacherous landscapes of Arrakis in the award-winning board game <i>Dune: Imperium</i>!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Battle online, locally with AI, or against the formidable House Hagal.<br/></li><li>Earn Achievements that showcase your prowess as a leader.<br/></li><li>Embark on more than a dozen Challenges that will test your wit and cunning.<br/></li><li>Compete for badges in the rotating Skirmish Mode where no two games are the same!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body1_2.png?t=1710341900"><br/>Arrakis. Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body2_2.png?t=1710341900"><br/>In <i>Dune: Imperium</i>, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.<br/><br/>The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Footer.png?t=1710341900"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

These magnificent additions feel more alive and detailed than ever before, giving your guests a unique and memorable experience as they marvel at the stunning new species, including fan-favourite bioluminescent variations, making nighttime an awe-inspiring experience. <h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome these extraordinary hybrids:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Spinoceratops was first introduced in season four of Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, and DreamWorks Animation’s hit series on Netflix, Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous. This species is instantly recognisable from its impressive fin to its imposing horn; however, DNA analysis indicates that Spinoceratops is a predominantly peaceful species.  <br/></li><li>Stegoceratops, one of Dr. Henry Wu’s creations, was first showcased in Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment’s 2015 film, Jurassic World on Dr. Wu’s computer. The Stegoceratops’ intimidating horns coupled with its spiked tail, neck, and back make this armoured species a formidable foe.  <br/></li><li>Ankylodocus, the largest bioengineered species, boasts sharp spikes on its back and a clubbed tail making this gentle giant a thundering presence in any park. <br/></li><li>Spinoraptor is a genetically modified species. This predator possesses the cunning and ferociousness of its parent species: the Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. As a social creature the Spinoraptor requires a small group to remain content within their habitats.  </li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Content</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Main_Banner.gif?t=1710259123"><br/><br/>Dead by Daylight’s All Things Wicked delves into the depths of analog horror with <strong>new Killer, The Unknown</strong>, and <strong>new Survivor, Sable Ward</strong>. A new Map, <strong>Greenville Square</strong>, is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on unlocks 2 exclusive Cosmetics: <strong>The Unknown’s Garden Casual</strong> and <strong>Sable Ward’s Designer Corset</strong>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Killer_Power.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">THE UNKNOWN</h2>If you hear a soft voice crying out for help in the woods, stay the hell away. The true nature of The Unknown remains a mystery, barring one fatal certainty: to cross its path is to risk an unknowable fate.<br/><br/><strong>The Unknown’s Power: UVX (Unknown Venom X)</strong><br/><br/>Charge and launch a burst of UVX, which bounces once and creates a Blast Area upon impact. If they touch the Blast Area, they will become Weakened against your Power.   <br/>If a Survivor is Weakened, they will lose a Health State whenever they touch a Blast Area. Survivors can lose the Weakened status by successfully looking at The Unknown for a brief duration.<br/><br/><strong>Special Ability: Hallucinations</strong><br/><br/>During a Trial, The Unknown will intermittently create Hallucinations and leave them in its wake. The Unknown can highlight and teleport to any Hallucination, leaving behind a temporary Decoy version of itself. Survivors can Dispel Hallucinations, but only by staring at one while standing completely still. Weakened Survivors will take longer to Dispel a Hallucination, and any incomplete attempt will reveal their location through Killer Instinct. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Killer_Perks.jpg?t=1710259123"><br/><br/>The Unknown comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Unbound</h2>Unbound activates for a duration when a Survivor becomes injured. During this time, you’ll gain a brief speed boost whenever you Vault a Window.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unforeseen</h2>When you kick a Generator, your Terror Radius transfers to it for a duration. During this time, your Terror Radius increases and you become Undetectable.<h2 class="bb_tag">Undone</h2>Gain Tokens whenever a Survivor misses a Skill Check. When you damage a Generator, all Tokens will be consumed. For each Token consumed, the Generator loses 1% total progress and becomes blocked for 1 second.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_Survivor_Perks.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">SABLE WARD</h2>While some fear the darkness, Sable Ward embraces it. Fascinated by horror and drawn to all things wicked, Sable was among the few Survivors to willingly step into The Fog in search of her best friend Mikaela.<br/>Sable Ward comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Invocation: Weaving Spiders</h2>This Invocation can only be performed in the Basement and takes a considerable duration of time to complete. Survivors can see your Aura during the process and can join you, increasing the Invocation’s speed.  <br/>Once complete, all Survivors will gain a boost of Repair progress. On the other hand, you’ll be Injured and Broken for the remainder of the Trial.<h2 class="bb_tag">Strength in Shadows</h2>When in the basement, you can quickly heal without a Med-Kit. Afterward, the Killer’s Aura is briefly revealed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Wicked</h2>Gain the ability to successfully unhook yourself from Basement Hooks. When you successfully do so, the Killer’s Aura is briefly revealed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2661270/extras/Chapter31_New_Map.jpg?t=1710259123"><h2 class="bb_tag">NEW MAP: GREENVILLE SQUARE*</h2><br/>A slice of small-town Americana, long abandoned, long forgotten.

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/GreenDragon.gif?t=1709885067"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTER</strong></h2><br/><br/>Stolen Realm is a <strong>simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements</strong> where you control up to <strong>6 heroes, solo or through online co-op</strong>, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. <br/><br/>Stolen Realm features an <strong>innovative turn-based combat system</strong> where <strong>simultaneous turns</strong> allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!<br/> <br/>With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&amp;D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  <br/><br/>Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> – or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!<br/><br/>Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!<br/><br/>Carve a place in history with your sword and magic.

							Not all wars are fought on the open battlefield. Download The Saboteur to visit 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris, as you play tough Irish racecar mechanic Sean Devlin.

The Saboteur presents a fresh take on World War II and features dramatic cinematic elements.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_customisation_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Customize and create your own trial patient.<br/>Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.<br/>Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. <br/>Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_NOAKS.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_barlow.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_doris.jpg?t=1709677975"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INVESTIGATE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_investigate_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. <br/>Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.<br/>The Process:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Thaumaturge_accolade_616x320_steam.png?t=1709742147"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/TT_claim_EN_small.png?t=1709742147"><br/><strong>The Thaumaturge is an isometric, story-rich RPG with a unique take on turn-based combat, character development features, and investigation mechanics</strong>, facing you with morally ambiguous choices – set in a world teeming with mysterious powers and strange ethereal beings called <strong>salutors</strong>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/City_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>The year is 1905. Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Buka_2.gif?t=1709742147"><br/><br/>A <strong>thaumaturge</strong> bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for <strong>Wiktor Szulski</strong>, the game’s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktor’s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as <strong>salutors</strong> - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1684350/extras/Wiktor_3-01.gif?t=1709742147"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Shape your story</strong> – as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. <br/></li><li><strong>Develop your character</strong> – creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. <br/></li><li><strong>Experience unique turn-based combat</strong> and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.<br/></li><li><strong>Influence and manipulate</strong> the temperaments of other characters to bend their will to your liking. <br/></li><li><strong>Tame the power of salutors</strong> – use the unique set of their skills to gain an advantage while exploring the world and when bringing your adversaries to their knees. <br/></li><li><strong>See the world that’s inevitably gone</strong> – explore the uncommon, heavily researched historic period of the early XX century Warsaw, where crime and luxury are often two sides of the same coin. Meet historical figures and learn about their involvement in the story. <br/></li><li><strong>Created in Unreal Engine 5</strong> to deliver a detailed &amp; beautifully crafted world.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Of course, this is only if you can keep your focus while taking down every mechanical opponent in front of you.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/分割线.png?t=1709723687"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2811970/extras/Gif0012.gif?t=1709723687"><br/>So, are you ready to make a name for yourself as a participant in the new season?

The burning days passed by - the freezing nights too. And yet, we were still there. Nothing could have overcome our determination. It guided our steps. The atrocities of the new wars, all these repeated invasions have brought up in us old visceral forces that we should never have known. And despite all that, there was nothing we could do to prevent it ... this genocide ... The whole earth is nothing more than a vast ruin, a shadow of a civilization that it has housed ... at the mercy of a planet that owes it everything.<br/>We didn't know it yet, but my companions and I weren't alone. We thought we were the last bastion of invisible resistance. In reality, we were the very first link.<br/>Billions of billions of kilometers away; allies, friends ... whole armies were preparing. A science from another time came to us and we were not only going to change the course of our destiny, but also that of all of humanity. All... of... Humanity. But that we didn't know yet."</i>  - Rover Hamilton, October 2417						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions.

But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory.

<i>After surviving more than 3000 years of dissension, fighting, and self-destruction finally we learned to leave together with mother nature and each other, but now mankind needs to face a new, never seen, powerful, external enemy.<br/><br/>Nobody knows where they came from but we realized quickly we have to fight to survive.<br/><br/>A small talented scout team gave their life to localize the base of the alien intruders, scientists working day and night created an enhanced version of our probably biggest invention of all time, a teleport that can send the brave human fighters right inside the enemy base.<br/><br/>But the crux is just coming right now, our heroes must search and acquire all the possible information about the enemy base to hopefully be able to destroy it ...</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1856830/extras/Cover_base.png?t=1710360419"><br/><br/>During the game, you must, destroy lurking enemies, or just avoid or take over them, find and use hidden aids, destroy, deactivate, and avoid different kinds of gates, get through enemy waves, and be patient, accurate, and quick when it's needed, test your memory in the labyrinths.<br/>Do not forget to collect the missing pieces of the enemy base blueprint on each level to get to the next one and be able to unlock new spaceships!<br/><br/>You can select from 3 Difficulty levels, Practice, Normal, and Classic. <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> In Practice difficulty mode you have checkpoints saved to continue from a given part of a level, and 5 lives to complete each and every level<br/></li><li> In Normal difficulty mode you have 3 lives to complete each and every level<br/></li><li> In Classic difficulty mode you only have 3 lives to complete the whole game</li></ul><br/>The game now has a Leaderboard too, but only Normal, and Classic mode results are participating, sorry ;)<h2 class="bb_tag"><u>Spoiler Alert! </u></h2>The game has a physics-based movement system so your space-ship moves with a bit of inertia, it could take a while to get familiar with it, figure out how to avoid or take over e.g. the enemy missiles, but do not give up, it is worth the effort I promise ;)<br/>Precision and accuracy are also key to getting through the levels and you will need stamina too as in Normal Difficulty mode you only have 3 lives to solve a single level, and in the good old Classic mode only 3 to finish the whole game!						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">What is Multicrash!</h2>Multicrash! is a simple retro-arcade-survival game where the goal is to get as many points as possible. Manage up to four roads, swapping the ship between two lanes on each road to avoid obstacles, pick up coins for points, or spawn another road. Each round starts off easy, but the speed of the game accelerates over time until surviving on just one road becomes almost unmanageable. However, there are ways to keep the round alive even after reaching max speed. Both spawning new roads and crashing will reset the game speed (yes, crashing can be good!) but remember, more roads = more points: Obviously having more roads means more coins spawn, but each coin is also worth the number of roads alive. This means that with four roads up, (4x coins spawn) x (4x coin value) = (16x efficiency!). The round ends when the last remaining road crashes. See how you compare by competing with others on the global leaderboard.						</div></div>]]></description>

You can confirm you’re on a ship, and you've been told that you're heading for Shanghai. Whatever the truth may be, the only thing you have left is a name: Elias. Who is he? Why is he important? and what does he have to do with your missing past? The only way to find answers is to venture forth, exploring an exotic and unfamiliar land.<br/><br/>EMPYRE: Earls of the Deep Earth is a classic isometric tactical RPG with a story-driven campaign. Taking place before the Great Flood that changed the EMPYRE world, your journey takes you through the land of China at the end of the 19th century.
