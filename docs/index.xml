<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Guragura Oden" is a casual balance puzzle game.<br>
Pile up the ingredients high in the unstable shaking earthenware pot.<br>
<br>
Ingredients<br>
Ingredients in this game are life forms with faces and hands.<br>
It would be nice if you could take care of them.<br>
<br/>
Hand-holding<br/>
If you connect the hands of ingredients, they are connected and your score will be increased.<br/>
If the ingredients are the same, they can be connected by other means than hands, so think carefully about where to drop them.<br/>
<br/>
■Exchange of pots and pans<br/>
When all the quota ingredients are placed in an earthenware pot, you can "exchange pots" to move to the next level of pots.<br/>
The score is calculated when you exchange pots, so you should pile up as many pots as possible before exchanging pots.<br/>
<br/>
■Skewer<br/>
The ingredients and connected ingredients that have been skewered will be fixed to the pot and will not fall out.<br/>
<br/>
Fever skewer<br/>
Each time you pile up ingredients, the gauge will accumulate and you can use the "Fever Skewer".<br/>
The ingredients that are hit with the "Fever Skewer" will disappear from the pot, so be sure to use it properly.<br/>
<br/>
The game is over when the ingredients fall out of the pot!<br/>
Relax and enjoy the game while looking at the cute ingredients.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Saint Orianne had to call upon all of her power to defeat him, since no one else stood a chance.<br/><br/>Now Loptr has returned, and his first move has already wiped out one of the world's strongest armies. However, it will be some time before he regains his full strength, so his victory is not yet certain.<br/><br/>Sword Princess Sistina is a fairly sheltered young woman, but her combat skills are first class. She sets out on a journey to discover Loptr's weakness and prevent his resurrection, together with her childhood friend Luis and his best friend, Rayne. Luis has the knowledge of a scholar, while Rayne's street smarts are unrivaled.<br/><br/>The three of them will encounter fantastical monsters, religious zealots with their own ideas of how Loptr should be confronted, and other demons who scheme against humanity on their way to fight the Demon God. Through their combined wits and abilities, they must save the Human World or be annihilated by the demons!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1551650/extras/Sword_Princess_Sistina_Description_2_EN.png?t=1709010016"><br/>In this RPG, every weapon you obtain will teach you new abilities for use in battle. Use status effects and formulate strategies to take down your enemies!<br/><br/>Explore and solve riddles to gain more powerful weapons and items; shops aren't the only source of superior equipment. Just be warned: while bosses have fixed strength, regular enemies grow stronger as Sistina does! Simply grinding won't be enough to secure victory and see Loptr and his underlings defeated.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1551650/extras/Sword_Princess_Sistina_Description_3_EN.png?t=1709010016"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1551650/extras/Sword_Princess_Sistina_Description_Sistina_EN.png?t=1709010016"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1551650/extras/Sword_Princess_Sistina_Description_4_EN.png?t=1709010016"><br/><strong>Explore a Fantastic World</strong><br/>The Human World is split up into multiple continents, and the areas you discover may contain quests that grant weapons and armor you can use to defeat the demons.<br/><br/><strong>Choose Your Strategy</strong><br/>You can fight Loptr with brute strength or follow the clever plan crafted by modern authorities. It's unknown which path will lead to the better outcome...						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Aki’s life is nothing to write home about. She lives in Tokyo, works at an office, and she whiles away her time playing MMOs. Aki isn’t exactly happy with her lot in life, but it’s all she knows, and she’s too tired from work to change it.<br/><br/>Aki is the last person you’d expect to go on a magical adventure…<br/><br/>Until she gets hit by a truck.<br/><br/>After being mown down on her way home from work, Aki is summoned to the land of Anthem by a cat-eared witch called Mina.<br/><br/>Mina is a talented mage whose skills far outstrip most others. She promises she’ll return Aki home in due course, after she’s had a chance to replenish her magical energy, but she wants Aki to do her a favor first.<br/><br/>The priestess Luna, whom Mina was entrusted with taking care of, has been kidnapped by malevolent forces, and Mina has no idea where she is.<br/><br/>Mina enlists the help of Aki, our heroine, and Scarlet, a cheerful foxgirl, to track down Luna and punish the brigands who kidnapped her. Our trio’s journey will be far from easy, however. Attacked by thieves, assaulted by slimes, and encumbered by Aki’s own incompetence, Aki’s new life in Anthem gets off to a poor start.<br/><br/>Can an awkward, unassuming office lady like Aki really become a hero?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/AkiBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Aki is the unwilling heroine of our tale. She’s quiet and soft-spoken, and she finds it hard to assert herself. Bullied by her co-workers and criticized by her parents for her lack of ambition, Aki struggles to see herself as a warrior.<br/><br/>Contrary to her demure appearance, however, Aki is handy with a sword, being a kendo champion in her teenage years. It’s been a long time since she last wielded a blade, however, and Aki isn’t too confident about her abilities.<br/><br/>Can she really pull this off?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/minaBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Mina is a highly talented mage, and she’s the catalyst behind this tale.<br/><br/>Mina might be a prodigy, but she’s proud and haughty alongside it. She’s aware of her own strengths and she doesn’t try to downplay them. As a result, she can come across as being arrogant.<br/><br/>Mina is cold and aloof to most people, but she absolutely adores Luna. She’s determined to find Luna again, no matter how long it takes, and she doesn’t care who she drags along with her.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2646050/extras/scarletBanner.png?t=1708972570"><br/>Scarlet is the third addition to Mina’s party, and she she has no shortage of energy. She’s a perpetually cheerful foxgirl who fancies herself as a brave knight, who was kicked out of her former party for being a little too enthusiastic while fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Scarlet is a fierce fighter who’s an asset to have on the battlefield…<br/><br/>When she isn’t scuppering well-laid plans by charging in like a lunatic, that is.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
