<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Raw Metal is a sci-fi stealth-action dungeon crawler with a focus on smooth, stylish gameplay.<br/><br/>You are a lone scavenger on the distant, barren exoplanet Charybdis. In search of gear and supplies, you infiltrate the depths of Katabase 6, a massive mining facility run by a corrupt megacorporation known as Orpheus Tech. Sneak through the mines undetected, cleverly utilizing various gadgets and equipment to your advantage, but beware; if you're caught, you'll need to rely on your combat skills for a fighting chance to escape.<h2 class="bb_tag">High-Stakes Stealth</h2><br/>Use taser darts, noisemakers, improvised concussion grenades, and more to slip past and isolate guards. The shadows are your domain; manipulate your environment and your enemies well enough and they'll never see you coming.<h2 class="bb_tag">Breakneck Combat</h2><br/>Combat in Raw Metal is fast and punishing. The guards stationed at Katabase 6 are stronger and more heavily armored than you, so fighting them head on will take skill, cunning, and a great degree of risk. However, mastering combos and using your environment will allow you to come out on top, and yield far greater rewards. Depending on whether it is initiated through a clever ambush or a stealth slip-up, combat can range from a calculated risk to a desperate fight for survival.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Blend of top-down stealth and third-person beat 'em up combat<br/></li><li>Freeform combo system that rewards aggression, improvisation, and precise timing and positioning<br/></li><li>50+ unique gear pieces to find and upgrade<br/></li><li>Distinct visuals for each gear piece to customize the look of your character<br/></li><li>Risk vs. reward extraction system that grants you the choice of cashing out your loot, or pushing deeper into the facility<br/></li><li>3 memorable and challenging boss fights, each with their own fighting styles, twists, and story development<br/></li><li>9 hand-crafted levels to infiltrate, with a few variants each to mix up your approach each time<br/></li><li>Environmental hazards and enemy variants to keep you on your toes as the game progresses<br/></li><li>5 deployable gadgets to utilize to your advantage in stealth and combat alike</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

A modern new Player Development Lab is here for every team that allows you to give players individual programs to work on, developing them how you like.

Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions.

But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							As an amalgamation of leftover memories from a dead brain and an AI implant, Anala Piers is neither human nor machine. But, is she something more or something less? Suddenly conscious in a world that does not want her and a body that does not belong to her, Anala does the only thing she can think to do: she demands answers.<br>
<br>
Prometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and machine-precision movement. Gameplay includes fast paced parkour movement and jumps, as well as stealth mechanics like sneaking, hiding, and wall sticking. Each stage is timed, allowing players to re-attempt levels for faster times, or even to challenge the clear times the developers set! In addition to main story levels, there are five challenge levels where players can test their platforming and parkouring abilities to the limits. In addition, many levels are open to explore in multiple ways, allowing the player to find hidden collectibles and other areas.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Introducing DOS (pronounced “doss”), the album, which composer for games, audio designer, and saxophonist Steve Pardo has also developed into an isometric music-driven platformer game. <br>
<br>
DOS, the album, is instrumental and cinematic in nature,  rooted in the jazz tradition, and consisting of influences spanning indie rock, electronic music, ambient, and classical musics. It is patient, evolving, melodic, and curious. It consists of seven songs written by game composer Steve Pardo during a season of his and his family’s move from Boston to Nashville, being a season of change and with a spirit of adventure and hope. <br>
<br>
DOS, the game, is a single-player, beat-based platformer, with a bit of puzzle solving, adventure game mechanics, and a subtle narrative. You play as a cube with eyes that blink, where every song on the album is presented as a level of the game. It is a story told as an adventure, simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, with just a touch of reactive challenges along the way, letting the music take center-stage.<br>
<br>
DOS is the debut project to be released by the indie game development studio The Pardo Brothers, which was co-founded by Steve and Jonathan Pardo. Steve Pardo performs on woodwinds, guitars, keys, synths, and FX, as well as Mike Baggetta on electric guitar and FX, Jon Estes on guitars and bass, and Brian Fitch on drums. Special guests include Liz Estes on violin, and Amy Pardo on flute.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Joe Dungeon is a game about managing decisions of risk and reward. The user will have to calculate aspects such as time, distance, enemies, cards, and more when deciding a path. There are objects scattered about the level that can either help or hinder the player. The user will have to make complicated decisions during fights to ration certain cards or not. Due to the high number of varieties in decisions, each run feels fresh and unique.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2220100/extras/Joe_steam_promo1.png?t=1710907282"><br/><br/>Joe Dungeon is not all strategy. There are many sections in the game which require the player to avoid spikes, sawblades, fire, turrets, swinging axes, and more. There are also different difficulties in the game if one finds the current difficulty to be unsuitable for their skill level.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2220100/extras/Joe_steam_promo2.png?t=1710907282"><br/><br/>Boards are not just meant to be played once. Each board will score the player based off of their time spent and difficulty setting used. If enough points are obtained, they can be used to permanently upgrade Joe and add unique twists to the game.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							XENOTERRESTRIAL is a game about a man whose xenophobia is not so much earthly as it about extraterrestrials. Different type of alien I guess.<br>
<br>
This top-down technical shooter, in the spirit of games like Hotline Miami and Ultrakill combines skill with strategy for a fast paced, challenging experience. A combination of a wealth of complex yet easy to learn mechanics and a great deal of customization make this an absolute must play for fans of technical shooters.<br>
<br>
Features include:<br>
<br>
7 Weapons to Use in Tandem<br>
Extensive customization (5 mods available for each weapon)<br/>
Several other cooldown-based mechanics (gear collected by the player)<br/>
A central narrative<br/>
A complex and diverse set of enemies<br/>
5 different difficulties for players of all ability (or those who are just looking for a different experience)<br/>
Performance related settings adjustments<br/>
Complex, technical mechanics reminiscent of games like Ultrakill and Doom<br/>
Secret levels and skins<br/>
Rewarding rank and leveling systems that encourage both progression and replayability<br/>
A style points system<br/>
An original soundtrack<br/>
And so much more!<br/>
<br/>
What does the game include right now?<br/>
At present, Xenoterrestrial includes only one chapter worth of levels (8 plus a secret level). I will continue to update the game, adding the rest of the chapters, along with much more such as bonus content, and (maybe eventually) even multiplayer.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a unique twin-stick arena shooter where your own actions define the difficulty. Shoot recklessly at the walls and you will drown in enemies, but shoot too little and you will have a mediocre score. Observe the different monsters's behaviours and be strategic in the way you fight them. The more monsters there are in the arena, the more points you get for each one defeated.<br>
<br>
Unlock and play in 8 different arenas with their unique monsters, take on contract levels to defeat specific sets of monsters, unlock clan levels for monsters you've seen on each of their 5 evolutions, take on seeded daily challenges which keep throwing new sets of monsters at you until you die, or play the gauntlet mode where you win coins and shop for upgrades that will last you until you run out of lives!<br>
<br>
The game plays either with mouse and keyboard, or with a game controller. You can play singleplayer or co-op with 2 to 4 players. A play session can take anywhere between 5 minutes and multiple hours depending on the game modes you take on and how fast you tire out! Perfect for both coffee breaks and extended play sessions!<br>
<br>
Features a banging original soundtrack by Pentadrangle!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
