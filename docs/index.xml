This is a damnation arc.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_episodes_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_stealth_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/><strong>Blood West</strong> is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_horror_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_characters_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>In <strong>Blood West</strong> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_secrets_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning - it’s probably cursed.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_brutal_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <strong>Blood West</strong> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <strong>POSTAL: Brain Damaged</strong>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_inventory_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that - once slotted - can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_weapons_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <strong>Blood West</strong> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines - a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1587130/extras/BLOOD_WEST_GIF_skills_EN.gif?t=1701798296"><br/><br/>The RPG-like perk-based progression system in <strong>Blood West</strong> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.<h2 class="bb_tag">Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</h2><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1587130/Blood_West/</a> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew!

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							SCP-087-B UE Remake is a fan game based on the original SCP-087-B make by Joonas Rikkonen, a single-player horror experience from the point of view of a D-Class sent to explore what lurks below in the unexplored and undocumented depths of an ever-changing brick and concrete staircase. Equipped with only a lighter, the D-Class must navigate dozens of floors until they reach, or rather if they reach, the lowest level. <br/><br/>Much of the audio, graphics and monster design is loosely or directly based on the original design of SCP-087-B, with several more creatures and threats added in beyond the scope of the original.<br/><br/><br/>Foundation Operatives grant all D-Class limited access to the associated documentation on this anomaly before entry, and recommends all subjects to brief themselves with the information before entry:<br/><br/><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-087-B<br/><br/><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid<br/><br/><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-087-B is located on the campus of [REDACTED]. The doorway leading to SCP-087-B has been disguised to resemble a storage closet consistent with the design of the building. The lock mechanism on the doorknob will not release unless ██ volts are applied in conjunction with counter-clockwise rotation of the key.<br/><br/>Due to the results of the first exploration (see Document 087-B-I), the door handle and locking mechanism have been removed from the inside of the door. Any personnel who enter beyond the threshold of SCP-087-B are presumed dead, and the door must not be opened if motion is detected inside.<br/><br/><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-087-B is an unlit concrete staircase with brick walls. The dark interior of SCP-087-B limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 meters. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087-B, as there are no lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than a lighter flame have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087-B seems to absorb excess light.<br/><br/>The entrance to SCP-087-B is inside a small room which was formerly used as a storage closet. When two or more subjects enter the room, it appears as a rectangular room with solid concrete walls and a single wooden doorway. Subjects have always described a sense of uneasiness when present within the room, despite having little to no awareness of the anomalous properties of the location.<br/><br/>Subjects who have entered this storage closet alone report observing a brick hallway opposite the entry doorway after they have been sealed within the room. Radio communication with subjects that enter the hallway becomes increasingly difficult as they descend the staircase, and attempts to converse with subjects which have gone beyond the 6th floor has proven difficult. <br/><br/><i>The full extent of SCP-087-B's anomalous properties are unknown, and further expeditions have been approved.</i> </div></div>]]></description>

							Lead the first settlement on Jupiter's frozen moon, Europa! What alien life lurks beneath the ice? Who is sabotaging your mission? Who can you trust?<br/><br/><i>Lies Under Ice</i> is a 200,000-word interactive science fiction novel by Joey Jones, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br/><br/>The year is 2079. Your mission is to build a settlement, explore Europa's treacherous oceans, terraform the moon, and send findings back to Earth.<br/><br/>But political factions within your colony vie for dominance, constantly on the brink of open conflict. While they are technically collaborating on this mission, each one has their own goals for Europa. Will this colony be a site for new trade? A home for Earth's ever-growing population? A clean slate where humans can break free of older social models? How far will each side go to get what they want?<br/><br/>With the most advanced science at your disposal—massive terraforming systems, gene splicing, AI therapy-bots, nerve-connected bionic prosthetics, and more—you can venture from the safety of your spaceship out into the hostile frozen world. Descend beneath the ice of Europa, pilot a submarine through frigid waters that no human has ever seen, and uncover ancient secrets of an alien world.<br/><br/>There's definitely alien life here.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">SUMMARY</h2>In 1928, a new star in the midnight sky brought with it hope and everlasting peace. A welcoming nova of intense burst radiation stripped Earth's protection as an age of prosperity would fall. In a state of emergency, with a cracked core and showers of radiation unleashing the foulest creatures of the depths, the Earth found itself in the middle of a larger and older cosmic conflict of grand scale.<br/><br/>Enforced conscription during a time of crisis tasked a group of locals to design and construct an airplane capable of reaching anominal readings detected over the North Atlantic. With a deadline arriving, a machine was hastily thrown together out of wood, fabric and a metal tube frame with minimal instruments. A resolute word from management selected you to be the pilot. A map has been produced for you, with strict instructions that you must immediately return your findings.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2>Set primarily in a flying claustrophobic fuel tank with an engine and a seat, you must fly and navigate using your map, course notes and stopwatch. Nobody will find you if you get lost over the open sea all by yourself. The windshield was removed to fit fuel needed, which means your forward vision is limited. You must instead trust your life on the instruments in front of you to come back alive.<br/><br/>Provided by the higher-ups in the military is a top secret aerial reconnaissance camera you must use to assess the selected locations. The government will use this as proof against you in case of insubordination.<br/><br/>Strange creatures from below notice your presence. The fear of getting lost eats you from the inside, you must stay alert and stay on course. No room to stretch your legs, no rest, no fuel gauge, creaks emanating from structural issues, will the machine will hold together? You pray, as the depths of the Atlantic does not like visitors.<h2 class="bb_tag">FEATURES</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Low fidelity graphics.<br/></li><li> Immersive setting with focus on audio design and mechanics.<br/></li><li> Unsettling atmosphere flying alone in the dark over the ocean.<br/></li><li> Unease of becoming lost and forgotten.<br/></li><li> Additional hard achievement for completionists.</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is a 3D action game inspired by traditional Chinese landscape ink paintings.</h2>You take on the role of a Qi army soldier, tasked with fighting back the Japanese pirate raids during the Ming Dynasty. After your unit's boat shipwrecks, you find yourself cast on an island controlled by the Wokou, Japanese pirates that have been terrorizing the Chinese coasts for decades. You are alone with your sword, the last soldier of the Ming Dynasty standing against the pirates – but your duty won't be fulfilled until your people's coasts are safe again. <br/><br/>Explore the beautifully painted landscapes of Fuling Island to defeat the 5 pirate bosses, each with their own unique characteristics, experiencing the most intense traditional melee combat. Embrace the challenge of this hardcore action game, rich in historical charm and martial arts depth!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/pkztf2.gif?t=1701920802"><h2 class="bb_tag">Fighting against Japanese pirates</h2>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty is set during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, rampant Japanese pirates plagued the southeastern coastal regions. General Qi Jiguang was tasked with combating these pirates; after successfully finishing his campaign, he headed north to Jizhou, pacifying internal rebellions in his path and guarding against external barbarians. But as the Qi's army moved north, the remnants of the defeated Japanese pirates gathered back its forces and conspired with other sea raiders from Fuling Island, readying to make a bloody comeback.<br/><br/>As a member of the Qi's army stationed to guard the coastal regions, specifically tasked with pacifying the seas, you were patrolling the waters when a storm shipwrecked your boat – and you find yourself a castaway on the shores of Ryukyu Island, the only survivor of your unit. With your sword by your side, you walk into the depths of the Island, set on uncovering and dismantling the clandestine plots of the Japanese pirates.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/pkzgs.gif?t=1701920802"><h2 class="bb_tag">Ink and wash painting world</h2>The game's art is inspired by traditional Chinese ink and wash paintings. From the humblest blade of grass to the most majestic mountains of Fuling Island, each scene is beautifully painted in ink and wash. Its artistic design also draws inspiration from ancient Chinese paintings' character styles and proportions, providing players with a captivating visual experience.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/动图5.gif?t=1701920802"><h2 class="bb_tag">Tactical melee with cold weapons</h2>The Last Soldier of the Ming Dynasty will put your reflexes and warrior senses to the test. Its combat system is built upon three basic attack actions: stab, cleave, and sweep, which form the basis of both offense and defense. While executing these moves, it is crucial to discern the enemy's attacks simultaneously. You can deflect their attacks by accurately anticipating the enemy's actions. Stay calm in the midst of the storm while you ponder the enemy's every move, and you will remain undefeated in battle.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/动图2.gif?t=1701920802"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/动图3.gif?t=1701920802"><br/><br/>The game offers a variety of combat styles, ranging from close-quarters melee weapons to long-range bows and arrows. You can either block enemy attacks with your weapons or utilize evading maneuvers and counterattacks. The key to overcoming adversaries lies in swiftly switching between offense and defense, adeptly countering their moves. Only by mastering the art of adaptation and switching styles you will ultimately triumph over your foes.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2494450/extras/动图1.gif?t=1701920802"><h2 class="bb_tag">Historical weaponry and armor</h2>The game offers a variety of weapons and equipment for players to choose from.
