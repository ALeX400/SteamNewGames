<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/SAVE_kopia.png?t=1706205624"><br/><i>Play as RIN, the last child of the Creator, on a journey to restore order in a mystical world. Collect aspects and runes, craft spells, and confront powerful bosses - your transformed siblings. The fate of the world rests in your hands.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/drive.png?t=1706205624"><br/>The story of RIN, her siblings, and their Creator, the Teller of Tales, was inspired by the well-known ancient myth about Cronus and his conflict with his children. It also touches upon the overall passing of gods who must be replaced by new gods. <strong>The creation myths</strong> seemed to match perfectly Metroidvania's dark fairy tale - no trace of man, but the importance of magic. An important motif and another layer of the script is the conflict between being obedient to authority - the father (the Creator) or freedom - the free will and responsibility for oneself and one's decisions. The story offers different possible endings based on your choices.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/REKINDLE_kopia.png?t=1706205624"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/gif1.gif?t=1706205624"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/craft.png?t=1706205624"><br/>There are<strong> 18 elemental spells</strong> from three categories: attack (10), defense (5), and utility (3).<br/>The spells are created of Aspects of Magic (5) and Spell Patterns. Then, they can be enchanted with a currency by Lesser Runes (adding more damage) or upgraded by an upgrade scheme and Great Runes (changing the effect). The quick slot allows assigning 3 spells at a time but gives an option to quickly swap to another spell set. Mathematically, considering the combination of Lesser Runes, Great Runes, and Upgrades, there are as many as <strong>7776 spells variants</strong>. As you progress, the spells can be disassembled in order to use the aspects components for another assembly. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/gif2.gif?t=1706205624"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/fight.png?t=1706205624"><br/>On your exploration journey, you will <strong>fight many small creatures</strong> formed from their locations such as Slimes, Mosquitoes, but also bigger creepy beasts like Rats or Spitting Plants. The main fights though, will not only require a neat set of spells and skills but most importantly the decisions to take based on your will. As RIN, the sixth child of the Creator, you will<strong> confront five bosses</strong> - your unknown siblings.<br/><br/>The fate of the world rests in your hands. Can you save everyone?						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Phantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...<br/><br/>The cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Asynchronous Multiplayer</h2>Explore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you and use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped. Watch and learn from the mistakes of up to 20 phantoms including your Steam friends that have attempted the same temple and steal their whips as they fall.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlock More Treacherous Floors</h2>Recover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.<h2 class="bb_tag">Blessings from the Gods</h2>As adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlockable Whips</h2>Unlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">Social Connections</h2>Players can share Temple Codes for their failed runs allowing friends to attempt the same temple or share their Adventure Code which yields a playlist of temples that a player has attempted in the past.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

							Portal: Revolution is a fan-made mod for Portal 2 which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/ezgif-7-f507c3c464_1_.gif?t=1705968827"><br/><strong>Over 40 new puzzles</strong><br/>The campaign contains 40 brand new puzzles making use of new test elements and presents existing mechanics in a new way not seen in Portal 2.<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Resurrected "Pneumatic Diversity Vent" element<br/></li><li> New laser cube variant<br/></li><li> Over 15 puzzles using only the blue Portal-Gun<br/></li><li> Gel Cleansing Field</li></ul><br/><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops, but fear not. All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich. It is a unique incremental game with interesting upgrades, and visuals to match the numbers. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/everything.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Hit the rock</strong><br/>What is the rock? Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Paper Flight – Relic Hunter is an interactive game experience that is designed to ease your mind and have fun popping innocent balloons.<br/>You jump into the role of a little paper plane that is supposed to rescue the world from evil balloon demons by dashing through them.<br/><br/>Fast, relaxed, chaotic - You are free to enjoy the game any way you see fit as the only enemies of the game are balloons which generally are not well known for being too dangerous. The movement is fast but the world itself is somewhat peaceful. This enables you to lean back and enjoy the different levels and the sensation of flying. It is an excellent game for relaxing and blowing off some steam after an exhausting day of hassle.<h2 class="bb_tag">The game also features:</h2>• Juicy balloon destruction and exciting dashes<br/>• A dash meter that needs to be utilized to save the world<br/>• Beautiful visuals and soundtrack<br/>• The experience of flying as a paper plane<br/>• Intuitive and relaxing gameplay<br/>• A moment of inner peace and happiness popping balloons and little balloon demons<br/>• A game that is enjoyable but doesn’t take itself too series – lean back and have fun<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Description</h2>You start as a tiny paper plane in a giant world.<br/><br/>You move continuously forward and are free to fly wherever you want.<br/><br/>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying as well as explored the giant environments for the first time you start to discover nearby areas and hidden secrets. Very soon you will find many normal balloons and a whole bunch of huge demon balloons floating around in the environment.<br/><br/>The normal balloons are soft and you can easily pop them by simply flying through them. The huge demon balloons on the other hand are somewhat hard and you are unable to destroy them by simply hitting them with your paper plane.<br/><br/>Soon you will figure out that there is a solution to the problem. Whenever you pop a small balloon, you receive a little bit of dash power which enables your paper plane to become faster and perform a powerful dash.<br/><br/>Using the dash, you are able to pop even the strongest of all balloons and therefore defeat the evil demon balloons. Now everything is a matter of exploration as you need to find all of the demon balloons while keeping an eye on your dash meter.<br/><br/>Once you have destroyed all demon balloons in a level, a second wave of them will spawn and later a third wave. Every level is structured in 3 waves and once you have finished all of them you will be able to enter the next level and explore more of the giant world with your small paper plane.<br/><br/>While the fast movement and the dashing add a somewhat fast-pace game play to the mix, the overall game is still pretty relaxing as after all your enemies are balloons and do very little to defend themselves from your attacks. It’s a unique mix of exploration, relaxation and a minimalistic balloon combat system that brings fun without the need of too much thinking or strategizing.						</div></div>]]></description>

That's all.<br/><br/>Dedicated to all brothers who have had similar emotional experiences.<br/><br/>Finally, I dedicate myself to the girls who have appeared in my life before. (CY, YYY, ZQ, NHT), Wishing you always be loved.						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							《Tomorrow's Love Puzzle》is an interactive live-action video game where you step into the shoes of a workplace employee named "Tomorrow". Harbored with life aspirations, you've been relentlessly trampled over in five years of working life. Yet, fortune smiles upon you as six beautiful women arrive in succession, immersing you in a first-person perspective love story.<br/><br/>The quiet and gentle school beauty, "Chu Chu".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/chuchu.gif?t=1706241010"><br/>The sexy and mature client, a female boss named "Jin Xiao".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/jinxiao.gif?t=1706241010"><br/>The mysterious girl, "Ni Keer".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/nikeer.gif?t=1706241010"><br/>The intellectual and stable baking teacher, "Yu Anran".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/yuanran.gif?t=1706241010"><br/>The straightforward and cheerful lifeguard, "Wang Yiman".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/wangyiman.gif?t=1706241010"><br/>The cute and kind childhood friend, "Tian Tiantian".<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2726890/extras/tiantiantian.gif?t=1706241010"><br/><br/>Product Features:<br/>• A novel live-action interactive game, experience immersive love stories with six distinct women from the male protagonist's subjective perspective. Who you end up with is up to "you" in front of the screen.<br/>• Unlike other romance games, we offer not only excellent film materials but also delve deeper into gameplay. Based on the storyline, players can chat with the heroines, view their social circles, and engage in other gameplay to understand more about the plot's periphery, deeply interacting with the heroines.<br/>• As the friendship level increases, the real past of the heroines will be unlocked, with more background stories awaiting your exploration.<br/>• We'll automatically tag exciting videos and pictures for easy browsing.<br/>• Unlock six uniquely styled girls - a cold and noble witch, an elegant and contrasting senior, an energetic straight-shooter sports girl, a cute and adorable girl-next-door, and a mysterious and ever-changing young lady. There's a type of warmth that will strike directly at your heart, and your love stories with them begin tomorrow...<br/><br/>Game Production and Theme:<br/>This game is produced by Youyuan Media, in collaboration with Youku Video and San Zhi Xi Que Media. It is the first game jointly developed with a mainstream video platform. In this era of frequent interactive video products, we aim to create a "different" product, offering men a top-tier emotional value themed on freedom and pure love. After months of development, we assembled a team including well-known scriptwriters, directors, and game production experts.<br/>The male protagonist is a humble office worker, repeatedly oppressed in five years of working life, facing his boss's manipulations and colleagues' squeezes - a true reflection of what many of us experience daily. Fortunately, he meets six charming but different women, bringing endless color and joy to his otherwise dull life. We hope that if you're trapped in life and work, you will find some comfort and joy here.<br/><br/>A Few Words from the Heart:<br/>Our team worked hard to polish a good story. The producers, directors, and scriptwriters argued daily over the plot to select the perfect heroines that cater to different players' aesthetic preferences from over 500 acting resumes. It turns out everyone has different tastes! To find a more authentic feeling of love, the game developers racked their brains to develop gameplay. Everything we do is to find "that soft spot in your heart", regardless of whether the person beside you now is right or wrong, or whatever your circumstances may be. We want to tell you that no matter what choice you make, tomorrow will be better.<br/><br/>About Youyuan:<br/>We are a group of young people from all over the country, with various specialties and personalities, gathered in Shanghai, dreaming of games and art. We aim to capture beautiful moments through the lens and games, delivering sweet feelings of love and freedom to our users.<br/>This is our first game, and we hope you like it.<br/><br/>Official QQ Group: 913764459						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
