True coexistence has now been achieved, and peace will continue for years to come—or so he believes.<br/><br/>One fateful day, a grave data-related incident results in him breaking through the speed of light, transporting Junnosuke and his friends to a parallel world.<h2 class="bb_tag">CHARACTERS</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2614070/extras/chara01_en.png?t=1708045221"><br/>Touka Reizeiin (Voice: Sakura Hanazawa)<br/><br/>FS representative and student council president of Minotsuki Academy. <br/>A girl with perfect looks and charisma—who leads her peers in the parallel world as well. <br/>Capable of overseeing everything from normal operations to strategic planning to direct combat and more, she is a major contender for Seiran’s strongest islander. <br/>Outside of work, however, she is even clumsier and sloppier than Asane—and that’s putting it mildly. <br/>Although she and Junnosuke are incompatible with each other due to their history, he has no choice but to look out for her here as she can barely take care of herself.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2614070/extras/chara02_en.png?t=1708045221"><br/>Rei Tadasugawa (Voice: Nanami Mizuno)<br/><br/>De facto second-in-charge as president of Minotsuki Academy’s disciplinary committee. <br/>Her skills range from miscellaneous duties to battlefield command, though as a dedicated worker, she ends up being pushed around by Touka in her daily life.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Wishlist_Follow_ENG.gif?t=1708054173"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708054173"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708054173"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708054173"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708054173"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708054173"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708054173"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708054173"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Be brave, and do not falter…"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/TreeLookingup.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the vast “Land of the Small" </h2>Traverse lake sized puddles, scale skyscraper sized trees, scramble through cavernous cracks in roads, as you experience a huge open world from a new perspective.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, what do you mean we’re moving?!</h2>Just great; just when Inco was getting ready to move on into his Senior year, his parents decide to uproot his life and move half-way across the country!<br/><br/>Guess it’s time to start all over. Sure, Inco didn’t have many friends (or any) back at his old school, and sure, he was so low on the social ladder that he had to get a deep-sea diving lesson…. Wait, why was he complaining about moving again?<br/><br/>I Wani Hug that Gator is a multi-ended, choices-matter visual novel about second chances and the power of accepting who you are. Shape how Inco makes the most of his final year, and how the relationships he makes along the way will develop. One relationship in particular has him feeling all fuzzy inside…<h2 class="bb_tag">The Prehistoric Romance a Million-and-One Years in the making!</h2>If there’s one good thing to come out of Inco’s sudden relocation, it’s Olivia. Bold and brash, Olivia seems particularly gifted in getting under Inco’s skin. No matter how Inco slices it, he and Olivia seem destined to go together like a particularly scaly sandwich. But the outcome of such a pairing is yet to be determined…<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, am I being graded on this?!</h2>Make friends, reconcile enemies, and figure out how Inco could possibly repair his miserable excuse for a social life.  But be warned: The choices you make expands the relationships with Inco’s classmates and determines which of the four unique endings you receive. Maybe Inco should’ve spent a little less time studying and a bit more time learning how to relate to people…						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

She is engrossed in her dancing and probably won't pay attention to you unless you get close, but if she does notice you, you'd better run…<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2809430/extras/gif1.gif?t=1708089046"><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>This game is a classic indie horror game. You need to explore the level looking for pictures. You have no weapons and no way to defend yourself, when you meet the Serbian lady you only have to run away. <br/>There are 3 levels available to you:<br/><strong>Forest.</strong> In the forest you need to explore the location to find 10 pictures of creepy creatures. Find all the pictures before the Serbian lady finds you. <br/><strong>School. </strong> At night, when all the people are already out of earshot, it seems that someone has performed some terrible ritual in this school and now this creature has appeared here… It seems to be aggressive only in the dark, and you have a flashlight, so everything is fine. Except the flashlight runs out of batteries quickly…<br/><strong>Abandoned hospital.</strong> You woke up in some abandoned building on the outskirts of the city and a Serbian lady is chasing you. All you have to do is run. Get to the exit and don't let the Serbian lady catch you.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2809430/extras/gif2.gif?t=1708089046"><h2 class="bb_tag">Atmosphere</h2>Thanks to Unreal Engine 5 technology, the game has realistic graphics and detailed environments.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Stupid Cupid has made a fine mess of this. He's found the perfect match for all of blobdom, but he didn't know the bouncy blobs can't turn on their own! Love is within reach, but they're all looking in the wrong direction.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796040/extras/Gif1.gif.gif?t=1708074055"><br/><br/>That's where you come in: it's your job to spin them around until two matching blobs are facing each other. When they lock eyes on their one true love, they'll roll forward and dissolve into each other. Dreamy!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796040/extras/Gif2.gif?t=1708074055"><br/><br/>If you want to make light work of Cupid's calamity, you can prepare combos to turn each level into an unashamed lovefest. Just line up blobs that have an obstacle in their way and the star-cross'd blobs will seek each other out once it disappears from the level.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796040/extras/gif3.gif?t=1708074055"><br/><br/>Of course there's nothing simple about love, and the blobs come in a multitude of flavours. Some are a little greedier than others and want to find two loves-of-their-life. Others fancy something a little less straightforward and will will fall for blobs not only of their matching colour, but from across the spectrum of blobkind.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796040/extras/Gif4.gif?t=1708074055"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2796040/extras/Gif5.gif?t=1708074055"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>160 hand-crafted levels of varying difficulties<br/></li><li>Three unique blob types to discover and master<br/></li><li>Four amazing sets, each with their own combination of blobs<br/></li><li>Target scores add replay value – can you beat the best score on every level?<br/></li><li>Original music</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In Missile Wars players will defend their asteroid from waves of incoming enemy missiles, invest in crucial tech upgrades and launch decisive countermeasures.<br/><br/>Defence requires timing, dexterity, prediction and precision using VR or keyboard &amp; mouse. Targets must be prioritised based on threat-level and proximity, and despatched efficiently. A missed shot could have dire consequences.<br/><br/>Between waves players must manage their economy in order to invest in the tactical upgrades required to shift the balance of power. Is now the right time to put the enemy on the back foot with a devastating new missile - or better to hold back, beefing up the defences and vital resources?<br/><br/>As the match progresses the pressure ramps up; incoming missile waves are more numerous and varied, environmental events such as sandstorms and meteor strikes complicate the battlefield until one side's defences are breached. With their shields down, cities in ruin, and economy in tatters their asteroid is surely moments away from collapse - but could there be one last gasp at victory?<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> VR Support<br/></li><li> Online PVP in 1v1 and 2v2 modes<br/></li><li> Online Co-operative play in Survival mode<br/></li><li> Post-match stats</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>
