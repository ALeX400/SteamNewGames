<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2420880/extras/store-gif-01.gif?t=1707460594"><br/><br/>In <strong>WitchHand</strong>, you use cards to build your empire of witches. Maximize the production of your villages and use your resources strategically to upgrade and expand. Focus on trade, alchemy research, or war in order to secure your coven's place amongst the Council of Fates, influencing the destiny of all. Work with your neighbors to secure a better future or crush them and use their bones to fuel your spells. When the witching hour comes each night, your witch's powers are at their strongest, while unseen forces work against you. You must expand and manage your coven to new heights if you are to withstand the coming darkness. No rest for the wicked.<h2 class="bb_tag">A CIVILIZATION OF WITCHES</h2>WitchHand folds the 4X strategy formula into card-based gameplay.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Machines are taking over your world!</strong> Their buildings destroy forests, their factories pollute the earth and water. The air is filled with the hum of drones and ships. Your home is dying!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2777550/extras/gom_corruption.gif?t=1707557203"><br/><br/>You must act now! Be the natural disaster and wipe out the alien cities. Unleash the power of the elements and become the ultimate warrior god!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2777550/extras/steam_page_header_gameplay_600x240.png?t=1707557203"><br/><br/>Gods Against Machines is an action-packed roguelike RTS where every run is different thanks to a wide variety of spells and blessings, as well as procedurally generated maps. Here is what you will do in a typical mission of the campaign:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Protect and build your base</strong> - Huge crystals rising from the ground are your source of mana. Protect them and (optionally) build your base around them with spells that summon different types of buildings - mini volcanoes that bombard enemies from afar, or spirit dwellings that spawn powerful sprites to fight for you.<br/></li><li> <strong>Cast Epic Spells</strong> - Use your offensive spells to rain down destruction on your enemies - literally! Fire Rain, Thunderstorm, Meteor Storm - all powerful destructive abilities that unleash your wrath upon the machines.<br/></li><li> <strong>Control Corruption</strong> - Prevent machines from spreading corruption - either by destroying their terraformers or by cleaning the corruption yourself using various spells or minions. Do not let it get out of control or you will lose!<br/></li><li> <strong>Destroy the machines</strong> - destroy enemy buildings to deplete their resources - when they run out, you win!<br/></li><li> <strong>Boss Battles</strong> - When all of the machines' resources are used up, one of their commanders will appear - prepare for an epic final battle!<br/></li><li> <strong>Reap as many rewards as you can</strong> - the less corruption your world has suffered, the more rewards you will receive! Acquire new spells, add new abilities to existing spells, and use powerful Blessings to improve your build and find game-changing synergies!</li></ul><br/>But that is not all! Not only do you have several gods to choose from, each with their own special spells and mechanics, but there is also Gaia, the Mother of Nature. She will help you throughout the campaign and has her own special powers - and you will be able to activate some of them in each run! In addition, the game's roguelite progression is based on Gaia's powers:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>Meta Progression</strong> - Each run allows you to upgrade the abilities of Gaia, who will help you throughout the campaign. The more you play, the more powerful Gaia becomes, and the easier it will be for you to progress! Go beyond the normal campaign into the Void Realm - the game's endless mode. How far can you go?<br/></li><li> <strong>Synergize your powers with Gaia</strong> - Pick the right Gaia powers to activate and get crazy synergies that are otherwise impossible. Experiment, upgrade, and replay the campaign to get the overpowered build you need to conquer even the Void Realm!</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2777550/extras/steam_page_header_prologue_600x240.png?t=1707557203"><br/><br/>In this free prologue, you can try out two of the four available gods: Azzinoth, the god of fire, and Nadea, the goddess of water. You will have the full arsenal of their spells at your disposal, as well as dozens of unique blessings and curses. Gaia, the Mother of Nature, will also come to your aid, though only 5 of her 11 powers will be available for you to try. Even with these limitations, the amount of different builds you can try is massive. Progress through the campaign to level 12 (out of 40 total) and rain down epic destruction on your enemies!<br/><br/>The full game includes even more spells, a full campaign with increasingly tougher enemies to take on, and a challenge mode to push your build to its limits!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2777550/extras/gom_destruction.gif?t=1707557203"> </img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>This game is the second creation of "Lanota - Music game with story".</strong><br/><br/>An old, broken tuner, and a dark world that has yet to recover. Nevertheless, when they can't give up on purification, a makeshift tuner is created by combining a skeletal judgment line and a music-energy stone called a 'purification stone.' Taking care of this unstable invention and starting over again, there is a whole new style of performance that is more confusing, complex, bumpy, unpredictable, but sometimes colorful, dynamic, brilliant.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Characteristics of the game</strong><br/><br/>1. There is a judgment line that freely crosses straight lines and circles, and it is a unique system that remotely hits notes by controlling two 'purification stones' placed on it with eight key inputs. The nine types of notes, each in a different way to destroy, are designed to reflect the characteristics of the game, and the oddly woven patterns, combining all these elements, give you a shock you've never felt before. Enjoy 27 kinds of song pattern, which range from boringly easy to very challenging and difficult.<br/><br/>2. With the permission of Noxy Games Inc. and composers, nine great pieces from Lanota were brought.<br/>List of songs:<br/>Alice Schach and the Magic Orchestra - Teardrop del Rey<br/>FOIV - Rebind<br/>HyuN - Fighter<br/>Notorious(Nota &amp; TRIAL) - GIFT<br/>Powerless - Dragon's Sky<br/>brz1128 - Alexandrite<br/>Sound Souler - 414 PER SPEED<br/>Kry.exe - Broken Altair<br/>Raimukun - Nyarlathotep's Dreamland<br/><br/>3. Pictures that exclude characters and place more importance on color than shape fill the screen. Object design and illustration applied for each piece of music are somewhat clumsy and clunky, but on the other hand, they form a sensuous and profound atmosphere.<br/><br/><br/>2023.03 ~ 2024.02<br/>Devoting my senior year in high school, joversound						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Game Features:<br/><br/><strong>Clear and Intense Objectives:</strong><br/>Navigate challenging objectives in a fictional setting through dialogue or actions. Perhaps convince an architect to host a wedding in a palace instead of ruins (honestly, after visiting the ruins, I think the architect's idea is great, I was captivated by the description of the ruins' beauty. But I convinced him to host both), or engage in combat with giant talking scorpions armed only with a dagger on the Amethyst Plains.<br/><br/><strong>Personalized NPC Interactions:</strong><br/>Interact with NPCs who possess unique personalities, appearances, and backgrounds, serving as targets for persuasion or combat. You might discover that the mage you persuaded to fight against the demon army actually seeks to harness the demon lord's power for dark magic research—I was genuinely shocked. In one scenario, I played as an herbalist escorting my elder sister, who could absorb forest natural energy to heal herself, to gather herbs for treating a sorrowful ailment. Her regret upon seeing the state of the forest when we reached the mountain was palpable.<br/><br/><strong>Quick and Pithy:</strong><br/>A round now lasts five minutes, but who knows about the future?<br/><br/><strong>Dice Rolls:</strong><br/>Roll the dice to determine the success rate of your actions; for instance, attempting to unleash a miracle might have a 10% chance of success.<br/><br/><strong>Dialogue Generation based on GPT-3.5:</strong><br/>All in-game dialogue text is generated using GPT-3.5—why upgrade to 4? It's expensive. Currently, <strong>you'll need a key</strong> to access this feature. While I do have a public key ready, the balance inside may not be substantial.<br/><br/><strong>Multilingual Dialogue Exchange:</strong><br/>If you're interested, you can learn Chinese while conversing in the game.<br/><br/><strong>Choice-Shaping Storylines:</strong><br/>It's a GPT game; need I say more? Craft a unique gaming experience.<br/><br/>Game Overview:<br/><br/><i>Challenger's Odyssey</i> is a text adventure game powered by GPT-3.5, immersing you in a world brimming with creativity and imagination. In this game, you'll achieve clear and intense objectives through dialogue or actions, engaging in fierce conflicts.<br/><br/>Embark on an adventure in the imaginative and creative world of <i>Challenger's Odyssey</i>.

You are armed with a double barrel shotgun and you can switch between buckshot, birdshot and slugs which you must choose between wisely to maximize your damage output in any given situation.<br/><br/>Birdshot gives you a very wide cone but short range, ideal for taking out swarms of zombies grouping you. <br/>Slugs have long range and will pass through objects and other zombies but travels in a narrow line, best used when you line up zombies behind one another.<br/>Buckshot is a balance between range and width; your bread and butter for taking out zombies along with barrels and crates.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2406730/extras/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converted__1_.gif?t=1707523543"><br/><br/>Make use of portals and bullet time to extend and break up shots, killing more zombies in a single shot. Ammo and health potions spawn from broken barrels and crates which can also be destroyed with teleported shots, traps and dynamite, maximizing your ammo conservation.<br/><br/>Compete against other players on the Steam leaderboard to see who can kill the most zombies before they die or run out of ammunition!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2406730/extras/download__4___1_.png?t=1707523543"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Dead meat tells no tales!</strong><br/><br/>Captain Long John Silverside and his crew of scurvy sea-bulls have landed on the legendary Islands of Ser-Lloyn and incurred the wrath of the gods! It's every bull for themselves in a back-stabbing, treasure-grabbing struggle, and only one may survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle...<br/><br/><strong>Bullion: The Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle</strong> is a local multiplayer brawler for up to four players, featuring a cast of backstabbing bovine buccaneers and a unique blend of PvP and co-op gameplay. <br/><br/>Stranded on the Islands of Ser-Lloyn, the heathen gods have declared that only the one bringing the greatest offering of treasure shall live - so each pirate must grab as much loot as they can! Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle!						</div></div>]]></description>
