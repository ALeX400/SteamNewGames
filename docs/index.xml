<h2>About This Game</h2>
							No one could have imagined that the once peaceful world would be irretrievably lost. One day, everything fell apart, and the world turned into a massive pyramid. Various of creatures found homes on different "layers", each based on how high or low they were. With no physical paths connecting these layers, we could only travel using huge "portals".<br/><br/>The surviving humans live in the lowest, poorest areas of this new world. They call it the "Tower of Shards" and hope to reach the top of the world one day, breaking free from an unfair destiny.<br/><br/>While we won't give in to this strange fate, only a few people, known as "the Marked", can safely travel through the "portals". They're our last hope.<h2 class="bb_tag">Endless Expeditions: </h2>Since humans are living in areas with few resources, it's up to "the Marked" to start expeditions to bring back resources home. Unlock different characters, buildings, and items to equip your heroes and use their skills at the right time, making each journey unique. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2234200/extras/battle.gif?t=1706058505"><h2 class="bb_tag">Base Building &amp; Gear Merge: </h2>With the resources you've collected, you can build and expand human homes in many fun ways. As supplies grow and new buildings pop up, humans can start to help "the Marked" with all kinds of battle structures like buildings, gear, and other supplies. Expand your stronghold and merge equipment for stronger setups.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2234200/extras/build.gif?t=1706058505"><h2 class="bb_tag">Strategic Deck Building: </h2>With every new building in the stronghold, you'll unlock a bunch of fun, mysterious cards. The cards you use will change how you can support in battles. Always be ready to change up your cards based on what's happening in the expedition.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2234200/extras/map.gif?t=1706058505"><h2 class="bb_tag">Real Time Hero Combat: </h2>As things change on the battlefield, more and more "Marked" start to stand out. From brave warriors and strong knights to magical wizards and nature-loving druids, each has their special traits and skills. Use your leadership to recruit and lead them in the engaging real time combat.<br/> <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2234200/extras/heroes.gif?t=1706058505"><br/><br/>Besides the Tower of Shards, there are also other races who want to reach the top. Be ready for anything happening, learn from your expeditions, go through more portals, climb higher, break free from humans fate, and fulfill this eternal quest.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1916310/extras/gif1s.gif?t=1706027371"><br/><br/>To help ghosts cross over to the other side, you must first understand them.<br/><br/>Remnant Records is a horror investigation game for 1 to 4 players, in which you are the newest recruit of an agency that deals with these paranormal matters. Choose the role that fits your favourite game style, and face complex ghosts, each with unique behaviors and reactions. Your job will be to exorcise and free them with the help of your team.<br/><br/>To exorcise a spirit, you first have to understand it. Search the place and find the clues left behind: diaries, newspaper cuts, unusual objects. Understand the person they was before their death, and gather as many items that are closely related to them as you can. Once you're ready, all you've got left to do is start the exorcism, pray you've understood everything correctly... and survive until the ghost is freed from this world.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1916310/extras/gif3s.gif?t=1706027371"><br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Unique and terrifying ghosts</strong>, with their own appearance and behaviours. Encounter the mannequin that takes advantage of light and shadow to catch you off-guard, the blind runner that will find you if you make the slightest noise, and many other horrifying spirits.<br/></li><li><strong>Four different roles</strong> that can make every player have a substantial impact on the mission. Play as the bodyguard that can break down doors, or as the medium that closely connects with the world of the dead.<br/></li><li>Procedural contracts that tell a new and fresh story to decipher with every mission.<br/></li><li>Level up and unlock multiple features, such as customizable difficulty and modifiers that will make every mission a new experience. Set the difficulty of the ghost and of the investigation separately and make the game fit your playstyle.<br/></li><li>Cooperative gameplay with up to three other friends (or strangers), complete with in-game proximity voice chat. Ghosts also have unique abilities that only appear in multiplayer.<br/></li><li>Become an experienced ghost hunter through your missions, getting new knowledge as a player and filling your exorcist diary with strategies to survive the next contract.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1916310/extras/gif4s2.gif?t=1706027371"> </img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>
      <link>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2511500/Dominions_6__Rise_of_the_Pantokrator/?snr=1_239_new__145</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich. It is a unique incremental game with interesting upgrades, and visuals to match the numbers. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/everything.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Hit the rock</strong><br/>What is the rock? Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							According to cognitive psychology, searching for targets in space can be categorized into parallel and serial searches. Parallel search, an automated process, can handle multiple targets simultaneously at a constant speed regardless of their numbers. Serial search requires the conscious intervention at a slower but more flexible speed. Through training, some serial search actions can be automated, reducing response time.<br/><br/>For the two different search methods, <i>Drop Pane: Not Only Match-3</i> is designed with three gameplays: Match-3, Symmetrical Elimination, and Spell Elimination. Each of them consists of 19 levels in which the falling speed of the piece gradually increases. After completing level 9, you can unlock the optional Obstacle Block Mode, which randomly adds obstacle blocks to the playfield each time when you level up. Users can choose starting speed for levels 1 to 9 and starting height of obstacle blocks for levels 1 to 12, and unlock more obstacle block gameplay after completing the corresponding missions.<br/><br/>Color search exemplifies parallel processing. The match-3 mechanics, eliminating the blocks same color, tap into our intuitive understanding of color and enable the attention to concentrate on the arrangement of colored blocks. As a results, more pleasurable experience is obtained through continuous elimination.<br/><br/>Symmetric patterns gameplay requires to more conscious intervention. Symmetry is aligned with our aesthetic preferences, but identifying symmetrical targets is not an automatic process. Confirming symmetrical patterns' existence and guiding falling blocks to suitable positions require the storage and processing of substantial information in short-term memory. Successfully tackling this challenge demonstrates the competence in those professions demanding broad attentions, such as programming.<br/><br/>Beyond short-term memory usage, spell elimination gameplay involves extracting spelling information from long-term memory. Vocabulary, extraction speed, and attention span collectively influence on game performance, making it a gameplay style that demands on high intellectual comprehensive qualities.<br/><br/>The game's three modes form a progression from automated processing to complete conscious intervention. By continuous, incremental challenges completion, some serial processing tasks can be automated. As game performance improves, attention span and vocabulary extraction ability can be sustained and enhanced.<br/><br/>Please give your valuable comments on the game, I will always listen and improve the game, especially the spell elimination part. Since English is not my native language, it's hard for me to judge whether the difficulty is suitable for native users. My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:LarkDream@163.com">LarkDream@163.com</a>, Please let me hear your suggestions, thanks!<br/><br/>Wishing you an enjoyable gaming experience and benefitting from the game!						</div></div>]]></description>

Potions are your tools of choice. With your cauldron you brew your way through the world. But you've got to keep your balance. On one side of the scales is the terror you bring. On the other - your fame among the people. If the scales are tipped too much, someone will definitely come for your life. But it doesn't really matter, for your soul was lost long ago. And the cycle will continue.<br/><br/>While the shadow of the inquisition is yet far away, peasants, townsfolk and even the king himself are coming to pay their respects to you. Listen to their problems, learn their mysteries, unlock new recipes, and keep in mind that your benevolent or malevolent intentions will surely make a difference.<h2 class="bb_tag">Branching narrative.</h2> Meet a cast of weird petitioners with their incessant requests. Help them or follow your own agenda. Uncover secrets, play with people's fates or just make the cows sing. Potions you choose to brew for your visitors influence future events.<h2 class="bb_tag">Potion discovery.</h2> You begin knowing only a couple of basic recipes, but by experimenting with mixes you can unlock new ones. Not every problem can be solved with rat poison (but nothing stops you from trying). And no matter what gruesome end you've met in your last cycle, you get to keep all unlocked recipes. If you hit a block in your research, you can always ask for help, but are you ready to pay the price?<h2 class="bb_tag">Keep the balance.</h2> Don't let fame or fear get to your head. And remember: peasants have pitchforks and there's a lot of them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Plethora of endings.</h2> The multitude of potions and plot twists ensure high replayability. Some recipes, game mechanics and endings become unlocked only when certain conditions are fulfilled (like beating the main story or getting some game-ending events).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2251010/extras/ends.gif?t=1706087572"><h2 class="bb_tag">A cat.</h2> You have one and you can pet him.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2251010/extras/cats_step.gif?t=1706087572"> </img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Together, the four of you venture into a different world to face exciting challenges!<h2 class="bb_tag">Being a qualified chef requires more than just chopping meat and stir-frying!</h2>During the competition, you must gather ingredients on the spot, from stealing Harpy's Egg, slicing Red Scallion, peeling Aethercap, to hunting Cockatrice.

Each of the three factions believes that they can defeat the AI Scourge Legion and become the new rulers of the planet.

Exploration experience, small exploration levels, busy time.<br/><br/>From the developers:<br/>Everyone will think that this game has copied 《Stack Lands》, admittedly, what you see may be thought that even the UI is not even lazy to modify, here we are very sorry.<br/>At the same time, we are sorry and very grateful for the inspiration brought to us by 《Stack Lands》, we think it is a very good game mode, easy but not simple, in the stacked mode, we think there is still a lot of room to play, but we ask ourselves that we can't do it for the time being, but we hope that we don't add more to the snake. So we took the immortal as the theme, and added some elements that we think can be more enriched, such as card growth, life span limitations, exploration copies, etc., and at the same time, we thought to avoid affecting the experience of the stacking mode, which is not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's an attempt.<br/>This is a game developed by only two people, in the resources and time constraints, but also faced with the problem of survival, my partner and I do not have much choice, we had thought of doing space battles, but ultimately in this version did not materialize, and the future is also unknown. In the end, no matter whether you praise or curse, thank you very much for your attention to this game, I hope you have fun, and I hope you can support 《Stack Lands》. I hope you can support Stacked Continent. I also hope that there are people who can carry forward this mode better.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							No one could have imagined that the once peaceful world would be irretrievably lost. One day, everything fell apart, and the world turned into a massive pyramid. Various of creatures found homes on different "layers", each based on how high or low they were. With no physical paths connecting these layers, we could only travel using huge "portals".<br/><br/>The surviving humans live in the lowest, poorest areas of this new world. They call it the "Tower of Shards" and hope to reach the top of the world one day, breaking free from an unfair destiny.<br/><br/>While we won't give in to this strange fate, only a few people, known as "the Marked", can safely travel through the "portals". They're our last hope.<h2 class="bb_tag">Endless Expeditions: </h2>Since humans are living in areas with few resources, it's up to "the Marked" to start expeditions to bring back resources home.

As supplies grow and new buildings pop up, humans can start to help "the Marked" with all kinds of battle structures like buildings, gear, and other supplies. Expand your stronghold and merge equipment for stronger setups.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2234200/extras/build.gif?t=1706058505"><h2 class="bb_tag">Strategic Deck Building: </h2>With every new building in the stronghold, you'll unlock a bunch of fun, mysterious cards. The cards you use will change how you can support in battles.
