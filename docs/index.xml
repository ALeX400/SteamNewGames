In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion.<br/><br/>Take control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps.

Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Lead the survival of mankind</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif3.gif?t=1708527822"><br/>Recruit others to your cause and <strong>grow your army</strong>.

Every decision matters, impacting alliances, missions, and the overall survival of mankind.<br/><br/>Challenge your skills in skirmish and online multiplayer matches, facing off against AI or real-life human opponents in intense 1v1 and 2v2 battles.						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A rescue team is called out to investigate a distress signal coming from a ship identified as the MTS Endurance - a ship known to have disappeared 4 years ago on a voyage across the Atlantic.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1708088745"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1708088745"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif1.gif?t=1708527822"><br/><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate – Defiance</strong> is a <strong>real-time strategy game</strong> based on the Terminator: Dark Fate universe that follows the war between humanity and Legion's synthetic intelligent machine network.<br/><br/>In the<strong> single-player campaign</strong>, you take the role of a commander in the Founders, a force made up of the remnants of the US military and guide your army in an attempt to foil Legion's plan to exterminate the last remnants of humanity. In skirmish and multiplayer modes, play as three very diverse factions: Founders, Movement and Legion.<br/><br/>Take control of an army carried over from mission to mission on a series of large strategic maps.

Your battlefield tactics and choices have deep consequences that will impact through the campaign, with other factions and characters either joining you or fighting against you, and with certain missions being available or not depending on your actions. <br/><br/><strong>Your resources are limited</strong> and you must protect your army. Weapons of war receive damage through a modular component damage system where armour characteristics, component malfunctions and hull structure all affect if your troops survive.<br/><br/><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Lead the survival of mankind</h2></strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1839950/extras/gif3.gif?t=1708527822"><br/>Recruit others to your cause and <strong>grow your army</strong>.

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2FjQnsk3AhJ7" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/banner_discord_GamePlanet.png?t=1708458030"/></a><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_01.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Shoot, destroy, collect, craft and destroy even more! "Dark Gravity" is a fast-paced, low poly vertical shoot'em up game that features non-linear campaign mode with lots of enemies and bosses. Craft new weapons, upgrade your fighter and build an ultimate aerial war machine!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_02.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>After the fifth world war, there was peace in the world. For over a decade, the Grand Alliance has been leading humanity towards a better tomorrow by stifling all dangers in the bud. For some time, however, there is suspicion of a new threat that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>As a member of SAF forces, your mission is to take over the Shielton base, captured by unknown rebels. No one knows who they are and what they want. What's worse, even IMC forces couldn't drive them away from the base because of their advanced weaponry. Weaponry out of this world. But... are those rebels the main threat? Isn't there anything bigger behind all this? No time for questions! You must stop them at all costs!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_03.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Gameplay mechanics are very simple - destroy all enemies and try to avoid every bullet... well, at least those which can be avoided. Your special maneuver allows you to dodge normal projectiles. Even if you get hit, you will only lose one extra weapon! However, watch out for powerful bosses! They can thorn you into pieces with their ultimate unavoidable attacks!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_04.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>The story mode can be completed in a few various ways. Military operations are carried out on several fronts simultaneously. It's up to you which path you will choose. From battles high in the sky, through military bases, underground factories, collapsed mines and abandoned laboratories, to secret Arctic research facilities and the interiors of unknown civilization artifacts - you must go through all of this several times to accomplish all missions.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_05.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Every difficulty level is different. Improving your skills and fighter will help you out at facing hard and insane mode bosses, as they don't appear at easier levels. Enemy's layouts will change as well as their shooting patterns. At higher difficulties, you will also meet enemies that you have not met before.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1205130/extras/DG_Title_06.gif?t=1708458030"><br/>Collecting drop parts and blueprints throughout the missions will allow you to unlock and craft new fighters, weapons, and upgrades. However, remember that only playing at the highest levels of difficulty will allow you to achieve a pinnacle of technology. Uncover the crafting tree and develop unique power-ups!						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The year is 2020. A new virus – the New Death – has begun turning people into violent zombies. The government has collapsed, and a brutal paramilitary group has taken control over most of Latvia. The streets are not safe, and the police or army will not protect you.<br/>You turn the radio on. The military is announcing that one last ferry will be heading out to Iceland from the western shore. Escape will be granted to those with enough fuel for the entry fee, and enough courage to attempt the journey across zombie-infested Latvia.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1968630/extras/fight_600x.gif?t=1708448416"><br/><br/>Stories from the Outbreak is a turn-based roguelike zombie RPG. The combat is heavily strategic, allowing customisation in team composition and character progression, and the game features dozens of trinkets that provide passive bonuses following the best roguelike design practices. Between combats, you must make decisions about traversing the landscape, and written events force you to navigate the moral complexities of surviving in a hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Planned</strong> Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Form a team of survivors, each with unique abilities and personalities. Decide the fates of your team members as you go<br/></li><li> A wide selection of trinkets and abilities allows creative approaches to strategy, and the random element of roguelikes keeps the game fresh through many playthroughs<br/></li><li> Over 25 enemy types combine into hundreds of different encounters that will push your tactical thinking to its limits<br/></li><li> Search for supplies and face moral dilemmas in an event system where your choices matter<br/></li><li> Over 80 000 words of written content explore the lore of the Outbreak and the backstories of the various characters, and hidden surprises await even as you keep replaying the game<br/></li><li> Late-game replayability is reinforced by unlocking new trinkets (permanent progression) and various challenge modes</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1968630/extras/map_600x.gif?t=1708448416"><br/><br/>In this brutal world, not all of the people are going to survive.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_lOGO.png?t=1708466526"><br/><br/>Step into the epic, story-rich world of Mossflower in the first official Redwall story since 2011. "The Scout" is a linear action-adventure game told in three acts. Play as Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, as the young mice find themselves on the journey of a lifetime to save their home from ruthless pirates. Will they reach Redwall and save their friends before all is lost?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_1.png?t=1708466526"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Scout Act 1</h2>After months of training, betrothed mice Liam and Sophia are ready to graduate into fully-fledged Scouts: a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the land and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. Their initiate ceremonies are cut short when sea rats attack their beloved home. As the senior Scouts rally for battle, it's up to the Scout Corps' newest recruit to outwit the enemy, light the beacon, and summon aid from the surrounding woodlands - before there is nothing left to save.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_2.png?t=1708466526"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Scout Act 2</h2>The beacon is lit, troops rally to fend off the invading searats, and Liam reunites with his dear Sophia beneath the Lilygrove Lighthouse, but not all is well. Scumsnout's vengeful cries can be heard in the distance and it is revealed that our Scout's betrothed has been poisoned by the wereat's venomous bite. With no time to spare, the couple race to the Winsome Wraith, where a mysterious and dangerous stoat may have the antidote they seek. As if things weren't bad enough, the sea rats are moving inland and the shadow of a large predatory bird lurks just at the edge of the woods.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_3.png?t=1708466526"><h2 class="bb_tag">The Scout: Act 3</h2>After being mortally poisoned by Scumsnout's vicious maw, our young Scouts have made it to the Winsome Wraith in one piece, if just barely. While the mysterious stoat's treatment has bought some precious time, Liam and Sophia must now travel the rest of the way to Redwall Abbey for a more permanent cure. This is the dramatic conclusion of their journey through the murk of Portman's Slough, the miraculously-functioning puzzles of Grating Gulley, and the ancient ruins of the Otters' Den.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_Features_2.png?t=1708466526"><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2> <ul class="bb_ul"><li>A brand new original story set the winter before the events of the first book.<br/></li><li>A stunning woodland world inhabited by charming critters and villainous vermin. <br/></li><li>Two characters with divergent dialog for replayability.<br/></li><li> Unique real-time scent mechanic fitting for woodlanders who experience the world primarily through their noses.<br/></li><li>An assortment of achievements and collectables for the completionist spirit. <br/></li><li>Original soundtrack created especially for fans of Redwall.<br/></li><li>Fully voice acted by a talented cast of new and established actors.<br/></li><li>Engaging puzzles and side stories for those who delight in world building.<br/></li><li>Full controller support with multiple schemes to choose from.<br/></li><li>Anthology Includes all 3 Acts in one, with revamped lighting and controls.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Steam_Description_Section_Header_Mechanics_2.png?t=1708466526"><h2 class="bb_tag">Mechanics</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>"The Scout" debuts a dynamic scent system unlike any game before it. Rather than stagnant, pre-designed paths that imitate scent, particles read the wind and the environment to simulate realistic currents and pools. Scents themselves consist of parts and patterns designed around real scent theory.<br/></li><li>When traversing the world of Mossflower, you make use of your mouse agility to explore the world in a unique and wondrous way. Shimmy along ledges, scramble sheer cliffs, and even squeeze through impossibly small spaces. With courage, faith, and friends by your side, Mossflower's fate rests in your paws!<br/></li><li>Rely on stealth, wit, and agility to evade your enemies. Manipulate dull-witted vermin with scent and scent to avoid getting caught in their grubby paws. <br/></li><li>Use your trusty way glass to scope the area and identify danger. Rely on your home-made slingshot to solve puzzles, break pots, and activate traps.<br/></li><li>Decide if you will prioritize the mission and leave the others to save themselves or take the time to lend a helping paw. Some may praise philanthropy, still others would praise pragmatism.</li></ul><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/Untitled_Artwork.png?t=1708466526"><br/><br/>"The Lost Legends of Redwall™" is inspired by the wildly popular characters and world created by Brian Jacques in the Redwall™ best-selling book series, published by and on behalf of Penguin Random House and now announced for a major movie and TV series by Netflix.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/LicenseLogos.png?t=1708466526"><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2169570/extras/SomaLogos.png?t=1708466526"><br/><br/>"The Lost Legends of Redwall™" is a series of games and a proud collaboration between Redwall Abbey Company Ltd, Penguin Random House UK, and Soma Games.
