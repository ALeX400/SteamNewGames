<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>There was something rotten in that old hospital. You were just following your instincts that night. But, it was your pride that killed those people, including your partner on the force. With nothing to exonerate you, on a temporary insanity defense, they threw the book at you.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/bookatyou.png?t=1707404050"/></h2><br/>For ten years, you were haunted by unanswered questions, frightened by what you saw, and what you did. Now you’re scraping by as a private eye, operating out of a crummy apartment. One day, a strange case comes along, giving you an opportunity to clear your name once and for all. With your sanity at stake and rent to pay, how can you refuse?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/stepintoshoes2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Solve a wide variety of mysteries as Pinnacle City's cheapest Private Eye! From missing pets to murder investigations, your detective skills will either earn you fortune or face punches. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/explorepc2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Home to a wretched hive of scum and villainy, Pinnacle City is littered with black market trade, grafters, and players of all kinds. From the shadowy alleys of The Sprawl to the sleek skyscrapers of Uptown, each district holds its own charm and mysteries to uncover! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/castchars2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Each member of your entourage has their own distinctive personality and skill set. Some will follow you into battle. Others will try and undermine you. Who will you choose for your lineup and will they be with you until the bitter end?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/epiccombos2.gif?t=1707404050"><br/>Bad guys can jump out at you from anywhere and each gang in Pinnacle City has its own devastating attacks! But you can beat 'em back in turn-based combat using timed hits and blocks to increase or reduce damage. You can also partner with your entourage members to unleash devastating combo attacks!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/readsomething2.png?t=1707404050"><br/>Manuscripts teach entourage members a wide variety of skills. Learned skills can then be upgraded by skill points you get from solving major cases. With each upgrade, skills become more powerful, and your entourage can take on even more powerful enemies. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/gearup2.png?t=1707404050"><br/>Tune up your gear with modifications to fit your play style. Experiment with different mods and ammo types to deal varying types of damage and inflict status effects on enemies. Whether you prefer a technical approach or go in guns blazing, modifying your gear is key as you battle your way through the city.<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FRUtWc3RFJs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/754320/extras/Copy_of_Join_the_discord!__1080_×_1000_px___3_.gif?t=1707404050"/></a></img></img></img></img></img></img></strong> </div></div>]]></description>

Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes.

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/881020/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a puzzle game where you aim to clear levels by fitting ice blocks into holes.<br>
It's a simple operation that involves moving blocks on the field up, down, left, or right, but as the level increases, the difficulty becomes more and more challenging.<br>
The ice block will continue to slide until it hits an obstacle, so it's important to think about how you can stop it at the desired point.<br>
There is no element of luck or action, so it is recommended for people who simply enjoy solving puzzles.						</br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

In this 3D game, you can explore the land, and soon you will find that there is something amiss, something that could upend the Hoververse. Things are not as they should be, and it is up to our unlikely, yet valiant hero and heroine to put things back in order and bring peace back to the Hoververse. <br>
<br>
For the first time in the series, you can discover the mysterys of the Hoververse as either Hoverkitty or Hoverflea, which means you have multiple ways of completing a level. Hoverkitty is a robotic cat that can wield a sword for close combat, and Hoverflea is a robotic flea that shoots lasers for skirmishes that can be fought further away. <br>
<br>
A quest that you will find in most levels is Treat collecting. Sometimes you must collect Treats to pass a level.  Hoverkitty and Hoverflea can both collect Treats, but one advantage to playing as Hoverflea is that he is smaller than Hoverkitty, which means he can fit in smaller areas.  <br/>
<br/>
This has aspects of an adventure,3D, first-person shooter. You will meet old enemies, such as the Hoverkitty Hunters, and also new allies that can help you in the Battle for the Hoververse.<br/>
<br/>
This game also has some lore to it, for all you  Hoverkitty fans out there, so be on the look out for some new an old faces and facts.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In Parkour Posse, two players take turns as the “runner” and “on-deck” moving through a level. When the 1st player reaches the end of a level, they switches places so the 2nd player can make the return trip. The runner will control the onscreen character moving, jumping, and dodging their way across the level. The player on-deck will be responsible for controlling the camera so the runner gets a better view, and providing helpful boosts when the runner needs them most.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1666800/extras/about_game.png?t=1707368381"><br/><br/>The level doesn’t reset between runs, so anything the 1st player does in the level can potentially affect the 2nd. Level completion times are cumulative, so it’s important to work together to achieve the fastest times! Work together to run, jump, and dodge your way through 20 levels in theme park of a lifetime!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1666800/extras/about_game_2.png?t=1707368381"> </img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Unfortunately, the cats that the Quadrangular Programmable Inversion Device has been sworn to protect have gotten themselves into places they shouldn't be. With nerves of steel and a heart of gold, Q.P.I.D. is determined to rescue as many of them as possible, even if he has to bend the laws of physics to do it. Toggle gravity, blast enemies, avoid hazards, and collect cats before your battery runs out. Part platformer, part puzzler, Q.P.I.D. delivers a hero who's state of the heart.<h2 class="bb_tag">Instructions</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Flip gravity to move objects, enemies, and obstacles<br/></li><li>Rescue cats on each level<br/></li><li>Collect all hearts for a perfect score<br/></li><li>Keep Q.P.I.D. juiced with charging stations</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Hazards &amp; Helpers</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>LOLLIDROPS aren't tasty — they're nasty. These mines will explode when you get near, but they won't be triggered by swapping gravity.<br/></li><li>HEARTACHERS demand their personal space; get too close to these shuffling scorpions, and they'll zap you. They also devour hearts!<br/></li><li>BEAM UPS shoot deadly laser light straight out when they're activated — but you can flip their switches when you flip the gravity.<br/></li><li>WUVLIES make their way the only way they know how: End over end. You can blast these flipping foes, but beware — shortly after being incapacitated, they explode!<br/></li><li>BIG CRUSHERS do exactly what their name implies: They crush (on) you big time. Don't get trapped beneath them!<br/></li><li>HEARTIANS attack in swarms when disturbed and slow you down, so be ready to blast them all before they reach you.<br/></li><li>SPEED ROLLERS give you a turbo boost. Walk through a light-blue column and get ready for a rapid ride!<br/></li><li>BOUNCE PADS put a spring in your step, sending you skyward when shifting gravity might have some negative effects.<br/></li><li>TETHERS automatically collect nearby hearts. Avoid entering dangerous spaces just by tugging on these heartstrings.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Hints</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Q.P.I.D. might fall faster or slower than some of the enemies and obstacles. Use that to sneak past them during gravity shifts.<br/></li><li>Sometimes flipping gravity will put hearts right in the path of a Heartacher. Look for alternate locomotion paths like bounce pads and speed rollers to avoid that risk.<br/></li><li>Lollidrops can't be destroyed by blasting them, but they can be deflected with a barrage of shots. Use this to create opportunities to sneak past them. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Controls</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Move: Joystick/WASD<br/></li><li>Blaster: Button 1/Mouse Button 1<br/></li><li>Flip Gravity: Button 2/Mouse Button 2<br/></li><li>Self Destruct: Button 1/Mouse Button 1 + Button 2/Mouse Button 2</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Additional Options</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>F1 toggles CRT scanlines on/off<br/></li><li>F2 toggles CRT curvature on/off<br/></li><li>F3 switches in window size in windowed mode<br/></li><li>Back button on controller accesses CRT/windowed options<br/></li><li>F9 resets the game<br/></li><li>Alt-Enter toggles between 16:9 fullscreen and 4:3 windowed mode</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">About Digital Eclipse Arcade</h2><br/>A series of throwback games made for the Digital Eclipse community, Digital Eclipse Arcade is a celebration of pure arcade gameplay.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1323830/extras/Title_Screen_EN.gif?t=1707321776"><br/><br/><strong>The Story</strong><br/><br/>Shanghai, 2003<br/><br/>Suddenly, Baichuan senses something is not right with his life - sometimes, he feels he can see his memories, so real yet so unfamiliar. This all seems to begin with an unexpected invitation from Baichuan's ex-girlfriend, Qiuyu, who has been away for many years.<br/><br/>Twelve summer days, just like twelve lucid dreams...<br/><br/>"The time seems to be working anomalously on you."<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1323830/extras/Hospital_EN.gif?t=1707321776"><br/><br/><strong>The Characters</strong><br/><br/>Dream-chasing, freelancer artist - Fengyi;<br/>Troubled and misguided high school student - Xiaobo;<br/>A university student who is burdened by her family's issue - Jingxian.<br/>......<br/><br/>Even though their lives are a total mess, they still manage to carry on, embrace and accept their "regrets", and live to the fullest.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1323830/extras/Inqury_EN.gif?t=1707321776"><br/><br/><strong>The Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>Through the 'Topics' and 'Clues' gathered from everyday life, dive deep into the hearts and minds of your dearest friends.<br/><br/>To be comforted by them; To be inspired by them; To turn all the little things that happened in your life into your own strength, and eventually, at the finale of the twelfth night – <br/><br/>To " fix" the shattered dream.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1323830/extras/Street_EN.gif?t=1707321776"><br/><br/><strong>The Stages</strong><br/><br/>Classrooms, Bookstore "What-If", Neighbourhood Cafe...<br/><br/>Much of every boy and girl's life revolves around such a mundane city scene. And it is precisely within the mundanity that some new possibilities exist. The key to turning one's fate around may very much be held in the hand of someone passing by among the crowds on the streets...						</img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
