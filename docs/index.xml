<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1674920/extras/TitleLogo.png?t=1705355459"><br/><br/><strong><i>Explore an open world in this Victorian steampunk cRPG.</i></strong> Play as three characters with branching stories that intertwine. Investigate, interact, and take action to leave your mark on the world and its inhabitants. No random stat points here, use your skills to level them up, and trust your fate to our tarot card chance system. <br/><br/>So, how will you solve your problems? <strong><i>Combat, persuasion, magic, explosives?</i></strong> The choice is yours and all your cards are on the table; but be careful, the docklands aren’t for the faint of heart. <br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1674920/extras/Tarot.png?t=1705355459"><br/><br/><strong>Tarot Card Chance System</strong> – Leave your dice at home as you interact with a variety of characters. NPC’s react to your gender, race, appearance, and choice of dialogue, so you’d better look and act the part if you want the “right” results. But not everything is certain, luck plays a role and it’s all in the cards with our tarot card chance system. <br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1674920/extras/Stats.png?t=1705355459"><br/><br/><strong>Skill and Etiquette System</strong> -  The skills you use will improve your ability, while ignoring others will cause them to stagnate. Master the skills you choose and learn more about the world and its inhabitants to unlock special dialogue and skill-check options.<br/><br/>So go, see, do! And don’t be afraid to try the unconventional. Drown yourself in gin? Sure, provided you’ve got the constitution for it. Smoke that opium? Certainly, but be careful not to doze off— it might not be safe here. Put it all on black? You only live once, as they say. Even in failure you learn something…<br/><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1674920/extras/Map.jpg?t=1705355459"><br/><br/><strong>A Rich Open World to Explore</strong> - A steampunk fantasy-inspired Victorian London awaits; filled with interesting characters and locations.

More than just the sum of his parts, Otto wants more to life than servitude and utility.</li></ul><br/>Each character has their own mix of skills, equipment, and expertise, and they might just have to work together to succeed. Will you trust your companions, and should they trust you? Not everyone is a hero after all. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A large open world to explore, 20 different locations spread over the city’s east docklands<br/></li><li>Three playable characters<br/></li><li>Three intertwined stories to experience<br/></li><li>Branching narrative and dialogue system<br/></li><li>Character customization <br/></li><li>Tarot card chance system<br/></li><li>Single-player</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							"Momodora: Moonlit Farewell" is the latest installment in the Momodora series. Join Momo, High Priestess of the village of Koho, as she embarks on a divine mission to save her people from imminent destruction at the hands of the demon hordes summoned by a malevolent bellringer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell presents the account of the greatest calamity to befall the village of Koho, five years after the events of Momodora III.<br/> Once the toll of an ominous bell is heard, the village is soon threatened by a demon invasion.<br/>The village's matriarch sends Momo Reinol, their most capable priestess, to investigate the bell and find the bellringer responsible for summoning demons. It is their hope that by finding the culprit, they will also  be able to secure the village's safety, and most importantly, the sacred Lun Tree's, a source of life and healing for Koho...<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gorgeous pixel art and animation<br/></li><li> Action-packed gameplay focusing on melee combos, dodging enemy attacks, and firing arrows at enemies<br/></li><li> The "Sigil" system, which allows for greatly customizable play styles<br/></li><li> Intense and core-shaking boss battles<br/></li><li> Deep exploration into a world rich in lore and atmosphere<br/></li><li> Freely adjustable difficulty levels, allowing you to relax and explore the alluring world at your own pace or take on mighty foes for a real challenge</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Developer's Voice:</h2>Hello!<br/><br/>This is rdein, creator of the Momodora series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, “Moonlit Farewell”. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of Momodora 3. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games’ mysteries and questions.<br/><br/>I’m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I’m designing “Moonlit Farewell” to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of Momodora 1 to 3’s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don’t worry too much about “catching up”!<br/>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we’ve learned in the past 10 years. Please look forward to it!						</div></div>]]></description>

You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You find yourself trapped in a dream. Capture anomalies, meaning locations or phenomena that deviate from reality, with a camera. By doing so, you might be able to return to reality.<h2 class="bb_tag">How do I play?</h2>Please take a look at the image below. Can you spot any unusual elements? It's a game where you find them and capture a photo with a camera.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2753720/extras/example.jpg?t=1705396420"><h2 class="bb_tag">Two Modes</h2>There are two modes: Normal Mode and Nightmare Mode. In Normal Mode, an anomaly will always occur at each time. However, in Nightmare Mode, there are instances where no anomaly occurs. You will find themselves wondering whether there are no anomalies present or if they simply haven't been discovered yet.<h2 class="bb_tag">Playtime and content size</h2>The estimated time to clear the normal mode is around 20 minutes to an hour. There will be a total of 81 anomalies occurring (as of the pre-release stage. This number may be subject to change upon release). To capture all the anomalies, it may take several hours.<h2 class="bb_tag">Save Data</h2>Even if you stop the game midway, which anomalies you have captured is saved. However, the in-game clock time will reset to the beginning.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Videos and Streaming</h2>Feel free to publish gameplay videos or stream the game without contacting the developer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Recommended Graphics Settings</h2>Setting the Global Illumination to "High" or higher enhances the game's atmosphere thanks to UE5's Lumen feature. However, be aware that this can significantly strain your GPU, potentially resulting in slower performance.<br/><br/>If your FPS (Frames per Second) is low, consider lowering the graphics settings. After starting the game, pause it to see the FPS displayed in the top left corner. The FPS is adjusted in-game to range from 22 to 62.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2753720/extras/hosoku_en.jpg?t=1705396420"> </img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Such degenerate human beings are extremely dissatisfied with the Holy Spirit, because the reason why human beings have become like this is all the hands of the devil. Therefore, the Holy Spirit decided to punish the fallen human world, degrading all human beings into obsessive members who lost their feelings, and maybe even seduce the demon gods hiding in the dark by the way and destroy them together.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2144460/extras/PTP_steam_gif__3_.gif?t=1705400810"><br/><br/>      The devil has been absorbing the depraved beliefs of human beings for a living, but if human beings are directly degraded into extreme attachments without emotion, it will also affect the intention of the devil.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							In XXXX, there were multiple unknown spatial fluctuations on Earth, with strange beasts (some with strange abilities, codenamed EB) and unknown armies (mainly using mechs for combat, codenamed D&amp;D) appearing at the centers of multiple fluctuations. At the same time, there were strange changes in the local environment around the fluctuation space, and from then on, the Earth fell into a tripartite struggle. After a period of time, humans have initially mastered some of the techniques of D&amp;D for manufacturing mechs and training pilots. At the same time, due to the small number of D&amp;D, their power development is relatively slow, and most of the EB stay in place, which to some extent limits the development of D&amp;D, causing the three sides to temporarily maintain a balanced state. In this situation, the emerging free explorers collaborate with human armies to seek new breakthroughs...<br/><br/>This is a placement game with fewer clicks and waiting for revenue<br/><br/>In the game, you will experience the feeling of becoming an seeker while also becoming a bit of a town administrator<br/>When becoming an seeker driving mechas, complete tasks, earn rewards, accumulate resources, and gradually improve oneself; You can also find partners, team up for battles, and enhance team capabilities; It can also meet the needs of towns and increase the upper limit of towns and teams at the same time<br/>When becoming a town administrator, watching seekers complete tasks allows the town to acquire the resources needed for development. Although some conditions may automatically unlock, you can still decide when to unlock new skills for mechas, weapons, chips, and components, control the timing of launching a campaign against Disasters, and customize the design of mecha drawings to create your favorite mecha types<br/>The following are the main features of the game:<br/><strong> Manufacturing mecha - Design new drawings, manufacture different mechas </strong><br/><strong> Transforming mechas - Combining different weapons, chips, and components to build various distinctive mechas </strong><br/><strong> Strengthening mecha - enhancing mecha attributes </strong><br/><strong> Training pilots - changing pilot attributes and abilities, finding suitable mecha combinations </strong><br/><strong> Searching for partners - forming a team, fighting together, and completing tasks together </strong><br/><strong> Rich ability combinations - about 100 types of mechs, weapons, chips, components, and pilots in total, combined and matched with each other </strong><br/><strong> Improving Technology - By analyzing enemy data through combat, we can enhance our technological and scientific research levels </strong><br/><strong> Unlocking new capabilities - the ability to consume core data and freely control the unlocking of mechs, weapons, chips, and accessories </strong><br/><strong> Multiple task forms - require simplicity, flexible selection, no need for constant attention, can be completed with simple placement </strong><br/><strong> Conquer D&amp;D - Consume collected materials and freely dispatch troops to conquer </strong><br/><strong> Seek Area - Collect different material resources to manufacture mechas, weapons, chips, and components </strong><br/><strong> Collect raw materials - discover mining areas during exploration, dispatch teammates to automatically collect </strong><br/><strong> Research site- Discovering a base during seek, attacking can obtain research materials </strong><br/><strong> Three types of combat methods - normal, assault , and conquest </strong><br/><strong> Assault - Attack on a discovered research site, with a limited number of personnel, and will continue to fight until the end </strong><br/><strong> Conquest  - Dispatching troops to engage in large-scale battles with both sides until one side is completely killed.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Ogasawara Hiroki’s average life was turned upside-down the moment he became a babe magnet for a whole harem of sexy succubi.<br/>Hiroki has managed to court the attentions of a famous businesswoman, a talented idol, a beloved actress, an up-and-coming tennis prodigy, and he’s even attracted European royalty.<br/>Hiroki’s life is a busy one, and there’s never a dull moment: something which becomes even more apparent when Yue, the ruler of the succubus realm, barges into his house and asks for his help.<br/><br/>The newest member of Hiroki’s harem, Alice, is a fledgling succubus who has little knowledge of the human world. Having spent most of her life in the succubus realm, Alice is naïve and unworldly, and she has no idea how to fit in.<br/>Help Hiroki show Alice around Tokyo, introduce her to her fellow succubi, and try not to let her get too anxious. Alice’s self-esteem has always been shaky, and if things go wrong, it might just spell disaster.<br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2487490/extras/alice.png?t=1705341483"><br/>Alice is a young succubus who has lived an isolated life. She knows little about the human world, and often worries that she doesn’t fit in.<br/>Alice finds it difficult to express herself and she’s incredibly awkward. Her anxieties make her a tricky succubus to manage, but she’s incredibly affectionate, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure Hiroki knows just how much she adores him.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2487490/extras/yue.png?t=1705341483"><br/>Yue is the queen of the succubus realm, and she certainly acts like it. Aloof, haughty, and dignified, Yue simply oozes feminine grace and poise that some of the other succubi can only dream of.<br/>Yue might be young, but she is a force to be reckoned with, and she knows just how to get what she wants: Hiroki included.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2487490/extras/ayu.png?t=1705341483"><br/>Ayu is a popular idol who has legions of fans all across Japan. Her cheery stage presence, her adorable appearance, and her humility only bolster her image as a ‘perfect idol’.<br/>Ayu is so adorable, most of her fans believe her not to be a flesh and blood woman, but an angel descended from heaven.<br/>They couldn’t, of course, be more mistaken.<br/>Ayu is, in actuality, a succubus, and she’s a devious one at that. Two-faced and incredibly bratty, Ayu will often badmouth her fans, though she has a soft spot for Hiroki.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2487490/extras/cosmos.png?t=1705341483"><br/>Cosmos is a ditzy airhead who marches to the beat of her own drum. She’s a social media superstar with masses of followers, and she spends her time posting provocative photographs of herself online to satiate her salivating simps.<br/>Though Cosmos’s dress sense might be peculiar, she isn’t particularly attention-hungry. She simply wants to make people happy…<br/>And she prioritizes Hiroki’s happiness above everybody else’s.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2487490/extras/marina.png?t=1705341483"><br/>Marina is a businesswoman with a level head and an eye for a good bargain. She’s renowned both for her cutting edge fashion sense and her cutting tongue in the boardroom, and she’s amassed mountains of money during the brief handful of years she’s been in the business.<br/>While Marina might seem like the sort to put her work above all else, she also knows when to cut loose and have fun. Marina’s not above having a drink or two to idle away the hours, and she’s particularly fond of pampering Hiroki.<br/>What’s the point in having so much money, after all, without a cute partner to lavish it on?						</img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Surviving is not easy, since you need to explore supernatural locations, figure out what’s wrong and uncover the truth as fast as you can. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Anna_and_Helen.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>Learn more about John’s grandmother and her story <br/>As we know from the first game, his grandmother dies, but we barely know any of the circumstances. All we know is that she captured the curses and John tries to stay away from them until 6 AM. In Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage, we get to learn how his grandmother tackles the curses, and we also get to use her unique powers and intellect to make that a reality.  <br/>John’s grandmother lived in a mansion along with her family, also known as the Wilsons. Anna, his grandmother, also had a sister named Helen. Unlike the first game where the curse ended up going through the maid, in this game the curse goes through Helen, so you are going against the clock to try and save her as fast as possible! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/All_Road_Helen.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>Opening the gate of curses <br/>This time around we also need to complete the Gate of Curses mission, and we do that via finding materials and tools that are necessary to open the gate of curses and defeat the queen. However, that will not be an easy task. It requires a lot of work and attention, and you’ll end up near a lot of different enemies that you will have to face. Which is exactly why you need to be very well prepared, as this is a very demanding and challenging game.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Book_of_Curses.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>A large number of spells and creatures <br/>Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage adds a large number of new creatures, so you’ll have those from the previous game and many others. On top of that, you also have realistic spells and curses. These help add to the excitement and authenticity of the game, while bringing you a very engaging and fast paced gameplay. You can even use poison to acquire supernatural powers, which will help you survive. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Car.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>Incredible visual effects <br/>The sequel comes with an old-timey look, which makes it appropriate for the era we are playing in. We added a large variety of special effects to deliver an incredible visual style and appeal. That alone makes the game come to life, while immersing you in a very exciting and empowering world. It’s what makes this entire experience well worth the investment! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Dead_Bodies.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>Surviving the ultimate scare <br/>In Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage, everything is set against you, so the chances of survival are slim. Playing as John’s grandmother adds a great twist, but you still have to face a lot of horror creatures and ghosts. It really helps bring in a sense of fun and excitement, while allowing you to push the limits in a very intense and fun way.  <br/>If you like horror-themed, action-packed games, don’t hesitate and try out Deadly Nightmare Unwanted Heritage today. It’s an amazing, very fast paced game that you will enjoy again and again! <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2676700/extras/Helen_Red.gif?t=1705333244"><br/>Features: <br/>-A large number of ghosts and horror creatures<br/>-The game comes with a unique, old school visual style<br/>-Intense, action-packed gameplay<br/>-Complete quests and defeat the ultimate boss						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
