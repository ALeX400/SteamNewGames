<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>MIDNIGHT GHOST HUNT IS A <i>PETRIFYING</i> PROP HAUNT GAME TO PLAY WITH PALS! </strong><br/><br/>Lying in wait across a series of cursed locations, relentless spirits stalk the halls. Assigned to eliminate them are the Ghost Hunters, armed to the teeth with the ghoul-busting tech to banish them to another realm! Play both Ghost and Hunter in a chaotic 4v4 struggle between the living and the dead.<br/><br/><strong>TONGUE-IN-CHEEK HIDE-AND-SEEK</strong><br/>As a Ghost, conceal yourself inside seemingly harmless pieces of furniture to evade preying Hunters… but when their backs are turned, turn the environment against them with telekinetic bombardment. No chair, lamp, or grandfather clock is innocent in this hijinks-heavy frenzy.<br/><br/><strong>MIDNIGHT MAYHEM</strong><br/>The fun isn’t over yet...when the clock strikes twelve, the witching hour begins, and the Hunters become the Hunted. The tables turn and Ghosts become supercharged, giving Hunters a limited amount of time to survive their vengeful wrath.<br/><br/><strong>MURDEROUS 4v4 MULTIPLAYER</strong><br/>Play together and communicate with your team and ensure a triumphant victory, giving each other pointers on the paths enemies tend to tread. Create synergies with your team's abilities to outthink and outwit your opponents.<br/><br/><strong>HARNESS SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES</strong><br/>The restrictions of reality don’t apply to Ghosts, of course. Claim your supernatural powers, which include turning invisible, causing furniture to float, and conjuring a dangerous Ghostly miasma. Ghosts can even hide in plain sight by masquerading as a Hunter’s doppelgänger!<br/><br/>Ghostly Perks include dramatically increasing your weight, extending your possessing range, the ability to see nearby Hunters through walls, and much more. <br/><br/><strong>ARMED AND READY</strong><br/>Hunters must choose their weapons from a full range of hi-tech gadgets designed to cast out Ghosts from our plane of existence. Detect ghostly presences with the Spectrophone, Radar and Pathfinder, capture them with a Trap, and suck up their spectral remains with the Vacuum – or just blast them to smithereens with the Spectral Cannon, sledgehammers, harpoons, salt-spewing shotguns, and more.<br/><br/>Hunters can also select Perks to give them a special boost. Choose from an extra burst of speed, health-replenishing capabilities and a host of other powers to get ahead of the game.<br/><br/><strong>A BEVY OF BLOOD-CURDLING MAPS </strong><br/>Explore ten unsettling locations, including an abandoned theatre, eerie mansion and cursed carnival. Each map brings with it different tactical considerations and items to throw about… as well as plenty of opportunities to play tricks on the enemy.<br/><br/><strong>FRIGHTENING NEW FEATURES</strong> <br/>As it crept through Steam Early Access, Midnight Ghost Hunt picked up a gaggle of game-changing features, built on the feedback of its community of Ghosts and Hunters.<br/><br/>Dedicated servers and host migration support make setting up matches a breeze, while the Progression Tier and Challenge systems bring added competition to the hunt. Looking for less of the silly and more of the scary? The Experimental Darkness game mode lends a chill to the chaos. Not to mention crossplay, full controller support, and even the GhostMaster minigame to pass the time during the van ride to your next match!						</div></div>]]></description>

Don’t forget to wishlist the full game now!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_ship_anim.gif?t=1711025025"><br/><br/>Become a sea captain on a post-apocalyptic Earth completely covered in water and go on an adventure in a huge open world. Sail through storms, fight and trade, capture other people's boats or build your own, extract resources from the bottom of the ocean, reveal the secrets of the Age of Water world.<br/><br/><strong>Water post-apocalypse</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_1.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive.<br/><br/><strong>True open world</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_2.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base.<br/><br/><strong>Hundreds of unique ships</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_3.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. It’s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board.<br/><br/><strong>Fierce naval battles</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_4.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck.  You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements!<br/><br/><strong>Personal naval base</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_5.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources.<br/><br/><strong>Flexible balance between PvE and PvP</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2841350/extras/AoF_steam_discr_6.gif?t=1711025025"><br/>At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers. In Age of Water, everyone decides for themself who they are today - a peaceful traveler or a bloodthirsty pirate.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity.  Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1310410/extras/GIF_VIPIntro_2.gif?t=1710945887"><h2 class="bb_tag">A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness</h2>Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret.

A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat.<h2 class="bb_tag">A Story That Challenges Reality</h2>Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Raw Metal is a sci-fi stealth-action dungeon crawler with a focus on smooth, stylish gameplay.<br/><br/>You are a lone scavenger on the distant, barren exoplanet Charybdis. In search of gear and supplies, you infiltrate the depths of Katabase 6, a massive mining facility run by a corrupt megacorporation known as Orpheus Tech. Sneak through the mines undetected, cleverly utilizing various gadgets and equipment to your advantage, but beware; if you're caught, you'll need to rely on your combat skills for a fighting chance to escape.<h2 class="bb_tag">High-Stakes Stealth</h2><br/>Use taser darts, noisemakers, improvised concussion grenades, and more to slip past and isolate guards. The shadows are your domain; manipulate your environment and your enemies well enough and they'll never see you coming.<h2 class="bb_tag">Breakneck Combat</h2><br/>Combat in Raw Metal is fast and punishing. The guards stationed at Katabase 6 are stronger and more heavily armored than you, so fighting them head on will take skill, cunning, and a great degree of risk. However, mastering combos and using your environment will allow you to come out on top, and yield far greater rewards. Depending on whether it is initiated through a clever ambush or a stealth slip-up, combat can range from a calculated risk to a desperate fight for survival.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Blend of top-down stealth and third-person beat 'em up combat<br/></li><li>Freeform combo system that rewards aggression, improvisation, and precise timing and positioning<br/></li><li>50+ unique gear pieces to find and upgrade<br/></li><li>Distinct visuals for each gear piece to customize the look of your character<br/></li><li>Risk vs. reward extraction system that grants you the choice of cashing out your loot, or pushing deeper into the facility<br/></li><li>3 memorable and challenging boss fights, each with their own fighting styles, twists, and story development<br/></li><li>9 hand-crafted levels to infiltrate, with a few variants each to mix up your approach each time<br/></li><li>Environmental hazards and enemy variants to keep you on your toes as the game progresses<br/></li><li>5 deployable gadgets to utilize to your advantage in stealth and combat alike</li></ul> </div></div>]]></description>

Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body2_2.png?t=1710955211"><br/>In <i>Dune: Imperium</i>, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.<br/><br/>The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Footer.png?t=1710955211"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/GreenDragon.gif?t=1710442130"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTER</strong></h2><br/><br/>Stolen Realm is a <strong>simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements</strong> where you control up to <strong>6 heroes, solo or through online co-op</strong>, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. <br/><br/>Stolen Realm features an <strong>innovative turn-based combat system</strong> where <strong>simultaneous turns</strong> allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!<br/> <br/>With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&amp;D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  <br/><br/>Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> – or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!<br/><br/>Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!<br/><br/>Carve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield. <strong>Recover the Stolen Realm.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/CycloneKick.gif?t=1710442130"><h2 class="bb_tag">PRAISE FOR STOLEN REALM</h2><br/>“The tactical depth of Divinity: Original Sin” - GamesRadar+<br/><br/>“we’re losing our evenings to… Stolen Realm” - TheXboxHub<br/><br/>“A gorgeous looking game” - PC Gamer<br/><br/>“You can be a fire warrior.

I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.  Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_customisation_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Customize and create your own trial patient.<br/>Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.<br/>Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. <br/>Meet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials.  Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_NOAKS.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_barlow.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/steam_page_doris.jpg?t=1709677975"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>INVESTIGATE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_investigate_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. <br/>Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.<br/>The Process:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>

His unique class artifact the <i>Mana Stone</i> carries mana over through rounds allowing him to deal massive damage with high cost cards.<br/></li><li><strong>The Paladin</strong> can sustain heavy damage with his unique class artifact <i>Plate Armor</i>. He utilizes combos between offensive and defensive cards to deal heavy damage while maintaining his defensive stats. <br/></li><li><strong>The Viking</strong> deals massive damage through single turn combos while granting herself and her allies damage buffs and resistances. Her unique class artifact the <i>Three Leaf Clover</i> enhances her multi-attack playstyle, increasing her damage on every third strike. <br/></li><li><strong>The Bard</strong> is the most complex of the classes with a totally different playstyle from the rest thanks to her unique class artifact the <i>Musicians Trick</i>. Her artifact builds up power every time she plays a card, unleashing the stored energy whenever she plays her unique <i>Song</i> cards. Additionally, She utilizes poisons to her advantage, building up damage over the course of a combat. </li></ul><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2497910/extras/Realtime_Combat.png?t=1711124883"><br/>What makes <strong>Into the Dungeon</strong> different from other cooperative card-battlers is that <strong>all players act in real time</strong>.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Alchemist's Apprentice and you got yourself into some trouble. While sweeping the dorms you somehow managed to get yourself into the final test for your apprenticeship - which would be nice and well and all were it not for the fact that you started your training two weeks ago and know literally nothing about the subject.<br/>And what is that final test, you ask? Well, it is the Maze of Madness, of course. And it deserves that name. Because it is literally designed to drive you mad. So good luck getting out of there without loosing your marbles.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2597340/extras/logo_small.png?t=1711123636"><br/>Dungeon Crawlers are a staple of classic gaming. The first game of the genre was created in 1975 and throughout the 1980s and 1990s the genre enjoyed great success. This game is a loveletter to the genre, with a little twist, of course.<br/>First, there is no combat. Rather, the entire game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Each maze is randomly generated and requries you to mix and match various alchemical elements to complete the labyrinth. Of course these elements must be found first and more often than not traps make that job a lot more difficult. A ticking clock adds pressure to the mix and if time runs out you will end up going insane. Luckily you are provided with a map of each maze and maybe, just maybe, you can find a few upgrades to make navigation easier.<br/><br/><strong><i><u>Features:</u></i></strong><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Procedurally generated mazes - No playthrough will ever be the same<br/></li><li>Simple but addictive gameplay - explore, mix and match<br/></li><li>Modern QOL features to help you navigate - maps, upgrades and tooltips<br/></li><li>Completely playable with the mouse - keyboard movement is an option<br/></li><li>Wonderful music to keep you engaged - Composed by Aron Ben Elal</li></ul><br/><i>Enjoy this nice little throwback over and over again. You are the Alchemist's Apprentice and if you survive this test, you maybe can drop that 'Apprentice' from your title.</i> </img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Step into the shoes of the suave secret agent Franklin Benjamin in this single-player spy thriller interactive novel. In this high-octane, two-hour satire of James Bond and Mission: Impossible, you'll drive fast cars, seduce beautiful women, take on false identities, and do whatever is necessary to save the world<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Your Mission</strong></h2>In short, your mission is to save the world, same as always. This time, there's a madman threatening the world with weaponized satellite technology that can strike anywhere at any time, including wiping out other satellites. So it's up to you to ferret out his identity and bring him to justice - or take him out entirely. You're the only one who can stop him, so we're counting on you to accept this mission<br/><br/>Assisting you in this endeavor is the usual team - your experienced partner in the field, Virginia, and our resident tech whiz, Hatcher. But the success or failure of this mission rests on your shoulders and yours alone. This is a single-player game, after all<br/><br/><strong><i>There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight</i></strong> can be played with just a mouse. Gameplay consists of selecting the action or dialog you wish to take given the situation you’re facing. Although the life of a secret agent is complicated, playing <strong><i>There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight</i></strong> is simple<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Uncover the Identity of the Madman du jour</strong></h2>Our intel for this mission unfortunately doesn't give us a precise identity for this particular madman, but if he gains control of the airspace above the Earth, then he effectively controls the world. So flush him out and foil his scheme<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Think Before You Shoot</strong></h2>As a secret agent, it's not about who has the fastest trigger finger. Put your mind to good use and make intelligent in-the-moment decisions on how best to handle your current predicament. Only by out-thinking your opponents can you survive to tell the tale<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Save the World in Style</strong></h2>Make use of any and all gadgets in your arsenal to get the job done. And then after you best your foes, rub it in their faces with a well-chosen pun, of course<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Sounds Like a Winner</strong></h2>Although the game is text-based like a novel, an emphasis is placed on visuals and music to set the appropriate mood for each scene, changing based on whether you're in a safe location or you're exposed to danger<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Short and Not-So-Sweet</strong></h2><strong><i>There's Always A Madman: Fight or Flight</i></strong> aims to be about the length of a movie for a single playthrough (roughly two hours). During that time, you may very well have to do some not-so-nice things to succeed. You know, like engaging in shootouts, fistfights, and high speed chases. But that's okay - as they say, nice guys finish last. And we need you to come out on top<br/><br/>For reference, here are some similar games to help you get a further sense for what <strong><i>There's Always A Madman</i></strong> is like: GoldenEye 007 (and other James Bond games like Everything or Nothing), Mission: Impossible, Alpha Protocol, Hitman games, Splinter Cell games, Henchman Story, Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise, Framed, I Expect You To Die, Batman Telltale Series, The Wolf Among Us, Agent 64: Spies Never Die<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Q: Why make this game text-based? Why not use visuals?</strong></h2>A: James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, and Jack Ryan all started off in text format with novels.  I believe this is the right move for the project - as they say, <strong>the book is always better</strong>, so I think a more book-like experience works here.  The game's text will of course be supplemented with music to set the appropriate mood, such as whether you're in danger or in a safe spot<br/><br/>We're all counting on you to save the day. <strong>After all - if you don't save the world, then there can't be a sequel</strong><br/><br/>This game is the start of a new video game franchise called <strong><i>There's Always A Madman</i></strong>. <strong>Fight or Flight</strong> is the first game in this series - follow the franchise to be notified about this and future games in the series: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/TheresAlwaysAMadman" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/TheresAlwaysAMadman</a><br/><br/>Press kit for journalists and content creators: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F1JEw_r99uzERAWqJIU2tOwzl3AKQdPc_O" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JEw_r99uzERAWqJIU2tOwzl3AKQdPc_O</a><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres_Always_a_Madman_Fight_or_Flight" id="dynamiclink_0" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390500/Theres_Always_a_Madman_Fight_or_Flight</a><br/><br/>Follow the <strong><i>There's Always a Madman</i></strong> franchise to be notified about this and future games in the series: <br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/TheresAlwaysAMadman" rel="" target="_blank">The "There's Always a Madman" franchise on Steam</a><br/><br/>And don't forget to check out my previous game, the cozy RPG <strong><i>A Weekend in Puzzleburg</i></strong>. <strong><i>There's Always a Madman</i></strong> is technically a spin-off of <strong><i>A Weekend in Puzzleburg</i></strong> since this new game is based on the Franklin Benjamin character first seen on a channel from the Puzzleburg hotel room TV<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1929760/A_Weekend_in_Puzzleburg" id="dynamiclink_1" rel="" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1929760/A_Weekend_in_Puzzleburg</a><br/><br/>Or check out these other spy video games on Steam from other developers:<br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574480/Agent_64_Spies_Never_Die" rel="" target="_blank">Agent 64: Spies Never Die</a><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318870/Pizza_Spy" rel="" target="_blank">Pizza Spy</a><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801480/Agent_A_A_puzzle_in_disguise" rel="" target="_blank">Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise</a><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322450/FRAMED_Collection" rel="" target="_blank">Framed Collection</a><br/><br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170760/XIII__Classic" rel="" target="_blank">XIII - Classic</a> </div></div>]]></description>

The book is your weapon, and your only one. Your life depends on it.<br>
<br>
The book starts out as as a weak projectile, but with the power of adding pages with upgrades written on them, the book can change and morph into what is needed. Upgrades range drastically with some playing a more supportive role such as a laser sight or a more offensive role, like changing your projectiles into knives.<br/>
<br/>
New pages can also be written by finding ink during runs. These pages can be written before a run starts to have a chance of dropping during the next run.<br/>

You will have to type in your guess to find out if you solved the case or maybe if you have found hint(s).<br>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Warning contains 8-bit-ish Retro!</h2><strong>Caution!</strong> This is a retro pixel art roguelike which might bring back memories you didn't even know you had. A flickering, humming CRT screen in your living room or bedroom back in the '90s after a day at school. What do you mean you weren't even born back then?<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>This roguelike puts you in the shoes of an unnamed adventurer who just woke up on the top level of Arkov's Tower. Try to fight your way down and escape it - or die trying.<br/><br/>Move your player trough numerous procedural generated levels. Fight numerous enemies including some unique bosses. The turn based combat system allows you to take your time and plan every move carefully. Upgrade your character with all sorts of items found in chests or dropped by enemies. In rare occasions you might find a wishing well, which allows you to upgrade your base stats. Can you make it to the bottom of the mysterious Tower?<br/><br/>Please be aware that this is a prologue, so more levels and bosses will be added in planned content Upgrades.<h2 class="bb_tag">Modding</h2> This game is highly customizable for people with pixel art and/or programming experience. Just have a look at the included manual and the Mod Manager in the main menu. Maybe you want to create your own story?

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2259130/extras/Emil_Trailer_Gif.gif?t=1711094935"><h2 class="bb_tag">STORY</h2>After Nazi forces take his father away, 11-year-old Emil must use the only two things he has left—creativity and imagination—as he embarks on a perilous journey to find his father. Inspired by the true coming-of-age story of a Holocaust survivor.<h2 class="bb_tag">GAMEPLAY</h2><strong>Emil: A Hero's Journey</strong> is a Cinematic 2.5D Puzzle-Platformer that combines intense action, stealth elements and creative puzzle-solving.<br/>Play as Emil and Interact with the world to creatively solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. Time your actions such as pulling, pushing, climbing, crawling, hiding and much more to avoid danger and find Olek, Emil's father.<h2 class="bb_tag">A personal note </h2>During the midst of Covid, I remember being locked up in my apartment, playing Playdead's masterpiece <i>INSIDE</i> and being blown away by it's art, atmosphere and of course puzzles. After finishing it, I felt a burning inspiration to do something related, but with my personal twist. For some reason, INSIDE's dystopic world, combined with a young boy surviving all on his own, reminded me of something... I didn't know what it was at first but then I understood - It was the survival story of my grandfather, Avraham Hartzook, as a young boy surviving all alone in Europe during WW2, hiding and running from place to place to find shelter.<br/>At first, I thought I would be good at creating video games if I was good at playing them. But after a year as a "one man band" and being part of my finals project at Tel-Aviv University, after doing code, animation and level design my self, I understood it would take me years to create something amazing and dealing with all this alone was very hard emotionally and technically.<br/><br/>From there, I luckily and happily paired with <strong>Afik Yaari</strong> (our Producer), <strong>Or Hadir</strong> (our Animator/3D artist) and later on <strong>Nadav Litver</strong> (our Technical Director) who we not only worked together but became close friends and a first circle for learning, guidance and more important, support group when times were tough (and they were).<br/>Looking back at the creation process of <i>Emil</i> I can definitely say there were many decisions (game design, production, animation) that could have been done different, and yes there's always place to learn and improve. However, I think, that for our first serious game, I am so proud of us and wouldn't do anything differently if I would go through this journey again.<br/><br/>Eventually, <i>Emil: A Hero's Journey</i> the child of a unique mixture of almost two and a half years of sensitive-intensive question asking, the love or video games as a medium for storytelling, thorough research and entrepreneurship. As this is currently a short version of the game, I hope that in the future we will gather all together again to create more emotional-compelling games or even a full length version.<br/>I truly hope this game (and maybe this little letter of confession) has touched you in some kind of way and I hope you will all be lucky as I was to pursue your dreams actively with the support of special friends and family.<br/><br/>If you read all of this,<br/>thank you.<br/>Ohad.						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/GIF_Gameplay.gif?t=1711091464"><br/><br/><strong>Golden Record Retriever (GRR) introduces <u>dice</u> instead of cards to the roguelike deck-building genre, creating a new genre of <i>Roguelike Dice Building</i>. Collect and upgrade unique dice that contribute to your team in their own way, and <u>grow from victim to conqueror</u> of luck and chance!</strong><br/><br/>On Earth, a golden retriever named <strong>River</strong> had an owner named "Paul".  An inventor, Paul's fascination with space and aliens led him to spend his life savings on building a spaceship.<br/>Soon, the ship is off into space, loaded with golden records of friendly greetings.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, Paul falls ill and dies. Lonely and alone in the empty house, River one day receives unexpected visitors who say,<br/><i>"The golden records your friend shot out have caused trouble throughout the universe.  You will now travel to the planets and retrieve the Golden Record".</i><br/><br/>With an enormous mission to save the universe, River sets out on a journey.<br/><br/>...But for River, who has only ever lived on Earth, life in space won't be easy - it's more like a <strong>puzzle</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Engine Building for Puzzle Solving</h2><br/>Each time, River is given a new mission and destination, and he must overcome a series of challenges as he builds his team to complete the journey.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/GIF_ThreeTerry_Eng_0322.gif?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>However, the situations he faces are far from typical combat. Instead, they're more like puzzles that require thought and deliberation.<br/>You'll need to place colored orbs called "auras" on the board to use Action Cards to resolve the situation. It's your <u>teammates</u> that create these auras, and it's up to you to <u>place your teammates in the right places</u> to solve the puzzle.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/GIF_CrewInfo_Eng.gif?t=1711091464"><br/><br/><i>Almost</i> every teammate has the skill to create auras. But they don't always do what you want them to do, because skills are represented by dice sides and abilities. If you want a blue aura and roll a die that shows blue on three of the 6 sides and red on the other three, you have a 50% chance of getting your wish.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/Capture_Upgrade_Eng.png?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>But don't worry, there are ways to control the <strong>luck and odds</strong>. As you work your way through situations, you'll have the opportunity to "upgrade" your teammates by changing the composition of the dice sides, or enhancing their effects and abilities to produce more auras or be more <i>reliable</i>.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/Capture_Shop_Eng.png?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>There is another way to upgrade your teammates: Gear. You can equip one piece of gear per teammate, and you can earn gear in a variety of ways, including shop purchases, situation resolution rewards, and planet scouting. With the right combination of gear, your teammates will be even more powerful than when you first met them!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/GIF_Antique_Eng.gif?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>Then collect "Antiques," the equivalent of the relics in the traditional deck-building genre. When their requirements are met, they provide you with the means to overcome an unfavorable situation, by generating bonus auras, healing your teammates' injuries, and so on.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/Capture_Briefing_resized_Eng.png?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>It's up to you how you build your team, with which teammates and items, but ultimately your team's goal is to succeed in the mission, so you don't want to stray too far from the direction the mission requires.<br/>Each new mission will determine the <strong>theme</strong> of the run. Just as you would adjust your deck build based on who the final boss is, your team build should be different each time based on where the mission takes you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Inspired by Legacy Board Games</h2><br/>GRR is heavily inspired by the legacy board game genre. Each mission follows the roguelike format, but the choices and actions you make will ultimately affect the universe. So, when visiting a planet to resolve a situation, it's good to go for an easy and quick option. But try to consider other options if they can buy you the planet's favor. Then the planet will remember your warm heart and repay you someday.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2119580/extras/GIF_RiverLike_Eng_0322.gif?t=1711091464"><br/><br/>Furthermore, the planets you helped and those you didn't will meet different fates in the great vortex created by the factions of the universe. To make matters worse, as the number of decaying planets increases, your mission may become more difficult to complete.<br/><br/><strong>But don't limit your imagination before you play GRR, because it also includes:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 80+ characteristic teammates<br/></li><li> 3 destinations<br/></li><li> 200+ visitable planets and countless routes<br/></li><li> 120+ gear items<br/></li><li> Antiques(Relics) and story cards</li></ul><br/>☉ <i>All names and stories in this game are fictional and have nothing to do with actual events or history.</i> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Gameplay is as simple as drag and drop what you want into the space. Players are given a room template that has a fixed isometric view, so two walls and a floor are the “shell” of the room. At game start up, players are given a catalog full of items to use in their rooms. There will be a variety of items to choose from so the player can decide what style of room they want. Some examples of items are bedroom furniture, kitchen appliances, and bathroom items. We’ve also done away with item collision restrictions, so players can merge items together to create “new items”. There is no overarching plot to the game, nor are there any side quests or prerequisites that may hinder one from decorating within gameplay. There is no in-game currency system that forces a player to “buy” furniture for their rooms. The objective of Cozy Room Decorator is simply to decorate. This game is especially for those that want to put together an aesthetic room, but perhaps don’t want to deal with the hassle and headache of learning a 3D modeling program. The integrated online community gallery will also help lend a hand in offering inspiration as players will be able to upload their rooms for others to view as well as download rooms for their own uses.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2615130/extras/features.png?t=1711090820"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2615130/extras/scenes.gif?t=1711090820"><h2 class="bb_tag">Cozy Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Decorate your room to show your unique style.<br/></li><li>Choose from thousands of items!<br/></li><li>Decorate Inside and Outside.<br/></li><li>Change the walls, floors or background of your room.<br/></li><li>Select from different lighting options, time of day or weather patterns.<br/></li><li>Pick different art options for different photo frames that you decorate with.<br/></li><li>Change the ambient noise sound effects to set the mood of your environment.<br/></li><li>Change the location of your room for a change of scenery!<br/></li><li>Upload Rooms to Community Gallery.<br/></li><li>Browse other player's rooms online to gain Inspiration.<br/></li><li>Backup and restore rooms from our online platform.<br/></li><li>Future versions of the game will have cross save enabled. <br/></li><li>Collision is disabled to allow merging items so players can be very creative!<br/></li><li>A sandbox game.
