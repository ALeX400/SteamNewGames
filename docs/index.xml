Dune. Desert Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserit. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.<br/><br/><i>Dune: Imperium</i> blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat… or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Body2_2.png?t=1710364055"><br/>In <i>Dune: Imperium</i>, you'll step into the role of one of the leaders of the Great Houses of the Imperium in a struggle to control the planet Arrakis and the invaluable Spice it provides.<br/><br/>The game plays out in a series of ten rounds, each of which is defined by a new Conflict on the surface of the planet; some award critical resources, and some provide Victory Points that will propel you to dominance. But choose your battles wisely: spread your forces too thin, and you'll find your enemies growing too strong to oppose.<br/><br/>Each round, you'll draw a hand of five cards from your deck, which will get stronger over the course of the game as you acquire new cards. Each card can be played in one of two ways: To send an Agent out into the Imperium to gather resources, or to Reveal at the end of the round to purchase new powerful cards. You must maintain a careful balance to get the most of the resources available to you. How will you find your path?<br/><br/>As your game progresses, you'll vie for Influence with four factions of the Imperium: The Emperor, the economically powerful Spacing Guild, the mysterious Bene Gesserit, and the ferocious Fremen of the deep deserts. Earning Influence among the various groups helps you to earn the Victory Points you need...but will you compete with your rivals for their favor, or abandon alliances to pursue other opportunities?<br/><br/>Many strategies are at your disposal, and many paths to victory. The cards are dealt. The choice is yours. The Imperium awaits.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1689500/extras/WORM_Steam_AboutSection_Footer.png?t=1710364055"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/GreenDragon.gif?t=1710442130"><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>TURN-BASED STRATEGY MEETS ACTION RPG IN THIS DUNGEON CRAWLING LOOTER</strong></h2><br/><br/>Stolen Realm is a <strong>simultaneous turn-based tactical dungeon crawling looter with action RPG elements</strong> where you control up to <strong>6 heroes, solo or through online co-op</strong>, venturing forth in adventures set in a high-fantasy, low-poly world. <br/><br/>Stolen Realm features an <strong>innovative turn-based combat system</strong> where <strong>simultaneous turns</strong> allow every team to take their actions at once, creating quick combat encounters that blend the tactical depth of titles like Divinity: Original Sin with the thrill of a fast-paced action RPG. Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!<br/> <br/>With a <strong>highly customisable class system</strong>, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging <strong>loot that truly changes the way you play</strong>: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&amp;D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.  <br/><br/>Keeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat.   After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each <strong>procedurally generated adventure.</strong> If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with <strong>6 different difficulty levels</strong> – or pick <strong>Hardcore Mode with permadeath</strong>, where every battle can be the last!<br/><br/>Also features <strong>Roguelike Mode</strong>, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!<br/><br/>Carve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield. <strong>Recover the Stolen Realm.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1330000/extras/CycloneKick.gif?t=1710442130"><h2 class="bb_tag">PRAISE FOR STOLEN REALM</h2><br/>“The tactical depth of Divinity: Original Sin” - GamesRadar+<br/><br/>“we’re losing our evenings to… Stolen Realm” - TheXboxHub<br/><br/>“A gorgeous looking game” - PC Gamer<br/><br/>“You can be a fire warrior.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Not all wars are fought on the open battlefield. Download The Saboteur to visit 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris, as you play tough Irish racecar mechanic Sean Devlin. Working with the French Resistance, Sean is out for revenge against ruthless Nazi Colonel Kurt Dierker, who executed Sean’s best friend.<br/><br/>This open-world action thriller takes you through the seedy streets of Paris as you seek to undermine the German authority and lead a rebellion. Fight across rooftops and through dangerous alleys, and operate a wide variety of vehicles as you navigate your terrain. You can even climb the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame Cathedral for a sniping mission.<br/><br/>Use stealth and disguise to strike at the heart of the Nazi war machine by disabling trains, destroying bridges, and blowing up enemy facilities. As you work to remove the oppressive forces from parts of the city, the drab black-and-white palette gives way to bright colors, signifying that you’ve inspired the townspeople. The more you incite the people, the more they’ll aid you by intervening in fights or providing a quick getaway from pursuing Germans. The Saboteur presents a fresh take on World War II and features dramatic cinematic elements. The action and intrigue is yours to experience via download on the PC now.<br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>First Ever Open-World Paris</strong> — Climb the Eiffel Tour, snipe from Notre Dame Cathedral, and brawl on the Champs d’Elysee as you sabotage your enemies. Fight, climb, and prowl through the dark alleys, rooftops, burlesque houses, and seedy streets of the City of Lights — the ultimate playground for the Saboteur.<br/></li><li><strong>The Art of Sabotage</strong> — Being the Saboteur is all about attacking while staying unnoticed. Get your mission intel at underground clubs and cabarets. Eliminate your adversaries with stealth attacks, disguise, distractions, and explosives.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Use only your mouse (or gamepad) to control your climber's hands to pull yourself up an enormous, treacherous mountain full of challenges and surprises. Watch out for slippery surfaces as you make your way towards the peak. Eternal glory and a wonderful gift awaits all climbers who manage to reach the top!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Enjoy:</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Punishing but not impossible gameplay. Practice makes perfect.<br/></li><li> No filler, every obstacle is designed with intention.<br/></li><li> Focused gameplay with no distracting elements.<br/></li><li> No violence. You can never die or get hurt. But you can lose all your progress with one mistake... perhaps that is worse.<br/></li><li> Climb, slip, fall. Over and over.<br/></li><li> Endless suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>But not:</strong></h2>- Legs... You cannot use your legs for some reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note from developer:</h2>This game was created by one person, me (hello).This game is inspired by Getting Over it with Bennett Foddy which in itself is a homage to an even older game, Sexy Hiking by Jazzuo. I was certain that Bennett's game would spawn countless of new types of games in a similar fashion that would present unique, focused and yet simple challenges. I was disappointed to see that trend not materialize fully and so took it upon myself to make this game, hoping to contribute to the spirit of a "Foddian Type" game genre.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Red Barrels invites you to experience mind-numbing terror, this time with friends. Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_synopsis_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_solocoop_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>You’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/>Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.<br/>Whatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society.  In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges.  <br/>Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete.  Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HIDE OR FLIGHT</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_hideorflight_616x295.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/>In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.<br/>The tools will allow you to <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Stun enemies<br/></li><li>Blind them<br/></li><li>See through walls<br/></li><li>Heal yourself and people around you.</li></ul>Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br/></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br/></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1709677975"><br/><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></img></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br/>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language. Please enjoy.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Outrun the storm while facing strange perils in a world that shifts with every journey into the Zone<br/></li><li>Your car, your way – scavenge resources to craft new equipment and configure your wagon how you want. Experiment with different mods and car parts to navigate a treacherous landscape, and look good doing it<br/></li><li>Unravel the mystery of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, an abandoned research site in an anomaly-filled version of the Pacific Northwest<br/></li><li>Original score by Wilbert Roget, II and featuring 20+ licensed songs</li></ul><br/><strong>DRIVE TO SURVIVE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/DriveToSurvive2.jpg?t=1708641540"><br/>It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.<br/><br/><strong>INVESTIGATE THE ZONE</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Investigatethezone123.png?t=1708641540"><br/>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you.<br/><br/><strong>REPEAT</strong><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1458140/extras/Repeat2.png?t=1708641540"><br/>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							This is a VR trip into the ancient world – playing Kottabos, the all-time favorite Greek party game. All the items you see around you are 3D reconstructions of actual ancient furniture, pottery, and Kottabos targets from museums. This historical game is harder than it looks! <br/><br/>In ancient Greece Kottabos was a popular party game in which players threw the dregs from the bottom of their cup at targets. These included a disk on the top of a pole and cups floating in a bowl of water. They competed for adoration, praise, and respect of the other party-goers.<br/><br/>Prove your skill by throwing the dregs of wine from your cup at the metal disk on the pole in front of you, or fling your drops at the little cups floating in a bowl. If the disk or the cups go down, your luck goes up! A round of applause, an extra dessert, or the favor of Aphrodite herself will come to the winners.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Physics-driven gameplay in VR.<br/></li><li>Controller momentum and trigger button throws the dregs.<br/></li><li>Aim at the different targets, and get higher scores based on strength of hit and placement on the target.<br/></li><li>Three different levels of gameplay.<br/></li><li>Tutorial level.<br/></li><li>Track your high scores.<br/></li><li>Educational! Learn about Kottabos, the real Greek party game.<br/></li><li>Free!

Despite the hiccups that naturally occur when a quiet librarian and an internationally famous music producer collide, they hit it off and eventually decide to meet up. The moment Rai takes off the futuristic helmet he’s known for always wearing, he reveals to Francis his biggest secret: he is actually a Dullahan, a mythical being who has no head.<br/><br/>While lugging around her own emotional baggage, can Francis make a relationship work with this nice young man who also happens to be a headless pop star?</i><br/><br/>- - -<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over 140,000 words<br/></li><li>9 different endings<br/></li><li>A heavily electronic, hip-hop soundtrack<br/></li><li>3 very cute cats — as you progress, unlock special scenes from the cats' POV<br/></li><li>the majority of the most emotionally charged scenes occur at Waffle House</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Please Take Note:</h2><i>the head well lost</i> is a commercial otome game with one character route that takes place over the course of about a year. Francis and Rai start dating fairly early on in the game. Thus, the maintenance of the relationship is the main point, not the pursuit.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of Rai's job, he and Francis are not always together. This is especially true for about the first half of the game. As a result, a good chunk of the story occurs through <strong>text messages</strong> and <strong>phone calls</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Content warnings:</strong> There are a handful of fade-to-black, text-only references to consensual sex. There are also textual depictions of legal alcohol consumption and some violence.						</img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The monsters in the dungeon are restless, attempting to occupy the mainland kingdom on earth! Warriors, pick up your weapons and go to the dungeon to eliminate monsters. Victory must belong to brave heroes!<br>
<br>
This is a Idle game,  a dungeon monster fighting game, and a game that takes your graphics card and computer to work all day. Of course, you don't have to go to work anymore. It's almost all automatic monster hunting. You just need to finish work, have a cup of coffee, and let the computer work automatically. When you go to work, you can turn off your computer and go offline. When you go online again, you will settle the profits from this period and put them in your backpack.<br>
<br>
Game core gameplay:<br>
<br>
Normal Dungeon<br>
<br/>
To unlock the next level, one must pass each level one by one and defeat the monsters on this level. The equipment dropped in each dungeon is different, and after collecting a set of equipment, you need to fight monsters in several dungeons. At the end of every 10 levels, there is a boss level. Winning the defending boss will unlock the next 10 levels of regular dungeons.<br/>
<br/>
BOSS Tower<br/>
<br/>
BOSS towers are all dangerous and powerful bosses, including some gatekeepers. Advanced book fragments, monster fragments, boss materials, and more have fallen inside. Defeating one boss will automatically challenge the next boss until you are defeated. Every day, you can challenge countless times and ultimately defeat your boss. If you fail, you can hang better equipment in regular dungeons, strengthen your equipment, and embed gemstones in your equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Infinite Tower<br/>
<br/>
There are both ordinary monsters and boss monsters in the Infinite Tower, which can gain a lot of experience and materials. They will challenge each monster until they defeat you.<br/>
<br/>
Suit<br/>
<br/>
The game provides sets made of BOSS materials, which can also be upgraded to higher-level sets. These sets have special effects and better attributes than ordinary equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Mining<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, if you need to obtain more gems, you can go to the gemstone mining area for mining, which is also automatically completed. Just collect the following gemstones after a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for strengthening, forging, and refining, they are all old ways of playing with equipment and numerical values. It goes without saying that there are too many, and the main focus is on numerical cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
There are two types of currency in the game: gold coins and diamonds. Gold coins can be automatically dropped when fighting monsters in dungeons. Just do the task with diamonds and sell the purple equipment in your backpack.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A unfortunate tragedy has happened in the city of Tokyo. Yuki who is destined to become the heir and ruler of Tokyo has been kidnapped by the powerful menace Lion Knight who wants nothing except to rule the city with a iron fist and become the city’s ruler. Lion Knight has placed experienced fighting ninjas across the city to stop anyone that gets in his way of destroying Yuki.<br>
Yuki has a sister named “Tokyo School Girl” the woman who wears a holographic dress so you can see her toned legs when she runs or is in combat, after all she wants you to know she has been preparing for this battle. Tokyo School Girl must defeat the ninjas of the city and rescue her sister who will become the ruler of Tokyo.<br>
Experience Tokyo School Girls journey in the epic open world of Tokyo and use souls-like combat with a sword and a gun.<br>
Lock on your enemy targets, dodge their attacks, pull levers that activate secret pathways, inflict damage on the ninjas, solve puzzles placed in the world, replenish your health, and make your way to defeat the Lion Knight and save your sister who is the only hope for the people of Tokyo! <br>
You must dodge fires and viscous attacks from the menace named the Lion Knight and ninjas across the city and use hand to hand combat and dodge mechanics to rescue your sister.<br>
It won’t be an easy task, this attack on Yuki was planned for a long time as Lion Knight holds a grudge against Yuki and Tokyo School Girls father and that is why he is causing chaos along with the desire of having complete control of the city. <br>
Lion Knight has heard many rumors of “Tokyo School Girl” and her fierce battles with criminals across the city in the underworld. <br/>
You must prove these rumors true to him, use your sword, gun, or hands and dodge enemy attacks, and find Lion Knight’s hiding spot in the city using clues across the map, and then come face to face with him and rescue your sister Yuki who is destined to rule Tokyo.<br/>
Lion Knight easily captured Yuki and would have gotten away with it if it weren’t for Tokyo School Girls popularity and her holographic dress that her legs peak through that caused talk around town along with her reputation as a jiu-jitsu fighter. Oh the urge of the people of Tokyo who quickly told Tokyo School Girl that her sister Yuki the future leader has been kidnapped by a big, mean, and metal giant of a knight.<br/>
Of course word got to Tokyo School Girl that Yuki was kidnapped. <br/>
Experience the third-person, open world journey of Tokyo School Girl in the beautiful city of Tokyo using souls-like combat with a gun, your hands, or sword, and dodge or jump from their attacks, or even jump over your enemies and then attack them to rescue your sister. <br/>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Playtime:</strong> 30 to 60 minutes <br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong> You will experience various anomalies such as hallucinations and auditory illusions in outer space.<br/>Utilize your auditory and visual senses to overcome these anomalies and successfully migrate to new planets.<br/>If you experience any hallucinations or abnormal conditions, proceed through the ‘West’ door. If you don’t, proceed to the ‘North’ door.<br/><br/><strong>Story:</strong> Fifteen years from now, as a black hole threatens to engulf the solar system, humanity has decided to migrate to the planet Trappist-1e. I was appointed as the chief engineer aboard the Hive spacecraft. However, during the astronaut test, I experienced severe anomalies such as hallucinations and auditory illusions after entering cryosleep. Yet, since these phenomena were unique to me, I pretended everything was normal and passed the test. As long as the antimatter engine remains stable until our arrival at Trappist. there should be no issues.<br/><br/><strong>Developer’s Note:</strong> Hive In Space began with the goal of “developing a game alone within 30 days.” As a non-specialist, I self-taught Unreal Engine. Consequently, there may be gameplay limitations, but I appreciate your understanding as you play.<br/><br/><strong>Distribution:</strong> If you could include the game’s title or a link to its Steam page in your livestream title or video description, it would greatly support a solo developer.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/Untitled_design__4_.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Prepare to embark on a musical odyssey like no other as you step into the spotlight as the lead soloist on the mesmerizing musical saw!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/6.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Ready for a new challange? The singing saw, with its ethereal tones akin to the theremin, presents a challenge unlike any other instrument. Its lack of traditional markers or keys demands precision and finesse from the performer, with every note subject to the subtle nuances of breath, posture, and movement. <br/><br/>Can you hold the note steady enough? Find out as you embark on the performance of a lifetime, playing your way through a single, 15 minute composition, orchestrated and directed by the greatest musical genius that ever lived; YOU!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/score_explain.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Controlled solely by the mouse, the Singing Saw Simulator responds dynamically to your every movement, refusing to "lock in" when the perfect note is struck. Prepare to be immersed in the exhilarating uncertainty of musical mastery as you constantly question: am I in tune?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/10.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Points are awarded for “correct” notes, but no extra rewards are given for high scores - i.e. The points don't matter! Yay! Instead, the game asks that you forget about points and envision the music as an experience; a performance in which you can relax and exercise your creativity in a safe space. To that end, the Singing Saw Simulator features several sections in which the player is encouraged to improvise across the 3+ octave range of the saw. If that sounds scary to non-musicians, then don’t worry; it just means you can mess around.<br/><br/>And remember - if you can create a melody that sounds more pleasing to you than the written one, then please do so. The Singing Saw Simulator acts as a real instrument, so get creative and carve out your own place in musical history!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/9.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>The accompanying soundtrack, aptly named "The Masterpiece," is a genre-defying opus crafted exclusively for Singing Saw Simulator. From classical elegance to jazz-infused rhythms, from pulsating house beats to twangy country vibes – each section showcases the singing saw as the star of the show. Get ready to rock out with a dedicated metal segment! Keep up as the piece moves from classical string quartet to New York soft jazz; from upbeat contemporary house to country and western; from horror soundtrack to the psychedelia of the 1960’s.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/8.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>But the excitement doesn't end there – with each playthrough, unlock a new spectrum of sounds for your saw, from haunting distortions to evocative vocal effects. Transform your performance on the fly with a simple scroll of the mouse wheel and watch as your music takes on a whole new dimension.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/12.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Prepare for unexpected challenges mid-song – from rating your performance to quirky mini-games like whack-a-mole and tic-tac-toe!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/11.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Why confine yourself to the one performance? Open up your media player, switch to windowed mode, and let your creativity soar in Freeplay mode. Jam along to your favorite tunes, experiment with new sounds, and make every performance uniquely yours.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2854670/extras/13.png?t=1710407488"><br/><br/>Why'd I make this game? Well. I bought a musical saw. It was difficult to play. But fun. So I hope you have fun too!						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>
