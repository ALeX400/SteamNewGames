<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/SAVE_kopia.png?t=1706205624"><br/><i>Play as RIN, the last child of the Creator, on a journey to restore order in a mystical world. Collect aspects and runes, craft spells, and confront powerful bosses - your transformed siblings. The fate of the world rests in your hands.</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/drive.png?t=1706205624"><br/>The story of RIN, her siblings, and their Creator, the Teller of Tales, was inspired by the well-known ancient myth about Cronus and his conflict with his children. It also touches upon the overall passing of gods who must be replaced by new gods. <strong>The creation myths</strong> seemed to match perfectly Metroidvania's dark fairy tale - no trace of man, but the importance of magic. An important motif and another layer of the script is the conflict between being obedient to authority - the father (the Creator) or freedom - the free will and responsibility for oneself and one's decisions. The story offers different possible endings based on your choices.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/REKINDLE_kopia.png?t=1706205624"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/gif1.gif?t=1706205624"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/craft.png?t=1706205624"><br/>There are<strong> 18 elemental spells</strong> from three categories: attack (10), defense (5), and utility (3).<br/>The spells are created of Aspects of Magic (5) and Spell Patterns. Then, they can be enchanted with a currency by Lesser Runes (adding more damage) or upgraded by an upgrade scheme and Great Runes (changing the effect). The quick slot allows assigning 3 spells at a time but gives an option to quickly swap to another spell set. Mathematically, considering the combination of Lesser Runes, Great Runes, and Upgrades, there are as many as <strong>7776 spells variants</strong>. As you progress, the spells can be disassembled in order to use the aspects components for another assembly. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/gif2.gif?t=1706205624"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1960070/extras/fight.png?t=1706205624"><br/>On your exploration journey, you will <strong>fight many small creatures</strong> formed from their locations such as Slimes, Mosquitoes, but also bigger creepy beasts like Rats or Spitting Plants. The main fights though, will not only require a neat set of spells and skills but most importantly the decisions to take based on your will. As RIN, the sixth child of the Creator, you will<strong> confront five bosses</strong> - your unknown siblings.<br/><br/>The fate of the world rests in your hands. Can you save everyone?						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Phantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...<br/><br/>The cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.<h2 class="bb_tag">Asynchronous Multiplayer</h2>Explore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you and use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped. Watch and learn from the mistakes of up to 20 phantoms including your Steam friends that have attempted the same temple and steal their whips as they fall.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlock More Treacherous Floors</h2>Recover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.<h2 class="bb_tag">Blessings from the Gods</h2>As adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlockable Whips</h2>Unlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">Social Connections</h2>Players can share Temple Codes for their failed runs allowing friends to attempt the same temple or share their Adventure Code which yields a playlist of temples that a player has attempted in the past.						</div></div>]]></description>

All new mechanics and advanced portal tricks are taught to you. We have ensured through rigorous playtesting that every player can solve the puzzles. Although very few chambers require portals to be fired mid-air, no puzzles require advanced tricky movement.<br/><br/>Depending on your experience with Portal 2 mechanics, you can expect about 5 to 7 hours of playtime.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/601360/extras/banner_story_2.gif?t=1705968827"><br/>Set inbetween Portal and Portal 2, Portal: Revolution tells a brand new story using new characters. You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.<h2 class="bb_tag">ENGINE</h2>Portal: Revolution uses a modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software.<br/><br/>This allowed us to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in Portal 2.						</img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							(the) Gnorp Apologue is a game where you help small beings called gnorps get rich. It is a unique incremental game with interesting upgrades, and visuals to match the numbers. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/everything.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Hit the rock</strong><br/>What is the rock? Irrelevant question — when struck, it outputs shards, and shards are amazing. They allow you to purchase and upgrade gnorps, and build new structures. The gnorps must have them. Hitting the rock is only half the battle, however, as the gnorps must retrieve the shards before they can use them. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/rs2.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>Acquire and upgrade gnorps</strong><br/>Gnorps represent the heart of the game. They are responsible for both shard generation and collection. Gnorps adapt varying methodologies to reach their goal. Some slam the rock with their heads, others shoot it with arrows and guns. You have gnorps that grow flowers, and gnorps that use psychic powers. They even build rockets and drones. All for a single purpose — the accumulation of shards.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1473350/extras/mountaineer.gif?t=1702589491"><br/><br/><strong>A strategic incremental </strong><br/>(the) Gnorp Apologue is about making numbers goes up, but how you do that is up to you.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. <br>
<br>
It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1704281211"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1704281211"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2662080/extras/ГИФ_заезд_в_город.gif?t=1706283603"><br/>Tour Manager offers you the role of a director of a travel agency, who has to create a successful business from scratch. You have to hire guides, buy buses, open attractions so that customers are satisfied with the services of your company. Run advertising to attract new customers. Manage the company's finances. This city needs a good travel agency!<h2 class="bb_tag">Manage your agency's finances</h2>Clients contact your agency to get to know the city better. And after the trip they evaluate the agency. The assessment is influenced by the cost of the trip, the quality of the bus, the skill of the guide, whether the client’s interests are taken into account, and the design of the agency’s office. Therefore, it is necessary to select the price of the tour so that there is money for development, but also not to upset clients. If suddenly there is a miscalculation with financial planning, then the bank will come to the rescue.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2662080/extras/бабки.gif?t=1706283603"><h2 class="bb_tag">Buy new buses</h2>You can add several bus models to the agency's fleet.

Tourists who contact your agency also have their own interests. Some are interested in historical places, some in natural beauty, others are looking for spiritual inspiration. Therefore, it is advisable to plan the bus route so that all passengers find it interesting.<h2 class="bb_tag">Develop your team</h2>Guides are an important part of the travel agency team. Green novices come to work for your agency, but over time they will become cool professionals. During excursions, guides gain experience and grow in level. When you level up, you can choose a guide perk.						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							A hidden object game where you must find all the snails and lettuce to complete each level.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2>🖼️ 15 Unique artworks<br/>❓ 1500+ Hidden objects total<br/>🐌 750+ Snails<br/>🥬 750+ Lettuces<br/>💡 ∞ Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br/>♻️ Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again! <br/>🎵 Music for each artwork (optional)<br/>🏆 Achievements<br/>⌨️ Use your keyboard to move / zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br/>💾 3x save slots<br/>🗑️ Reset progress entirely and play again<br/>🕒 ∞ Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class="bb_tag">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a canvas filled with polygons, and hide as many abstract bunny and carrot shapes as they can inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 15 abstract art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ hidden objects, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you have unlimited, unrestricted hints if you get stuck. Using hints will not ruin your score, or affect your ability to unlock achievements. Play at your own pace!<h2 class="bb_tag">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the hidden objects.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Paper Flight – Relic Hunter is an interactive game experience that is designed to ease your mind and have fun popping innocent balloons.<br/>You jump into the role of a little paper plane that is supposed to rescue the world from evil balloon demons by dashing through them.<br/><br/>Fast, relaxed, chaotic - You are free to enjoy the game any way you see fit as the only enemies of the game are balloons which generally are not well known for being too dangerous. The movement is fast but the world itself is somewhat peaceful. This enables you to lean back and enjoy the different levels and the sensation of flying. It is an excellent game for relaxing and blowing off some steam after an exhausting day of hassle.<h2 class="bb_tag">The game also features:</h2>• Juicy balloon destruction and exciting dashes<br/>• A dash meter that needs to be utilized to save the world<br/>• Beautiful visuals and soundtrack<br/>• The experience of flying as a paper plane<br/>• Intuitive and relaxing gameplay<br/>• A moment of inner peace and happiness popping balloons and little balloon demons<br/>• A game that is enjoyable but doesn’t take itself too series – lean back and have fun<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay Description</h2>You start as a tiny paper plane in a giant world.<br/><br/>You move continuously forward and are free to fly wherever you want.<br/><br/>After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying as well as explored the giant environments for the first time you start to discover nearby areas and hidden secrets. Very soon you will find many normal balloons and a whole bunch of huge demon balloons floating around in the environment.<br/><br/>The normal balloons are soft and you can easily pop them by simply flying through them. The huge demon balloons on the other hand are somewhat hard and you are unable to destroy them by simply hitting them with your paper plane.<br/><br/>Soon you will figure out that there is a solution to the problem. Whenever you pop a small balloon, you receive a little bit of dash power which enables your paper plane to become faster and perform a powerful dash.<br/><br/>Using the dash, you are able to pop even the strongest of all balloons and therefore defeat the evil demon balloons. Now everything is a matter of exploration as you need to find all of the demon balloons while keeping an eye on your dash meter.<br/><br/>Once you have destroyed all demon balloons in a level, a second wave of them will spawn and later a third wave. Every level is structured in 3 waves and once you have finished all of them you will be able to enter the next level and explore more of the giant world with your small paper plane.<br/><br/>While the fast movement and the dashing add a somewhat fast-pace game play to the mix, the overall game is still pretty relaxing as after all your enemies are balloons and do very little to defend themselves from your attacks. It’s a unique mix of exploration, relaxation and a minimalistic balloon combat system that brings fun without the need of too much thinking or strategizing.						</div></div>]]></description>
