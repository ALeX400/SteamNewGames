It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” <br>
<br>
In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. <br>
<br>
“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” <br>
<br>
The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: <br>
<br/>
New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. <br/>
<br/>
Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. <br/>
<br/>
SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. <br/>
<br/>
Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.<br/><br/>The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Biomes_6s_v2.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_4.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Foxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Villagers_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_2.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Experience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Roguelite_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_5.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/Monsters_6s.gif?t=1703400171"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1336490/extras/en_AtS_Headline_6.png?t=1703400171"><br/><br/>Laying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader).

These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create.

As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Hello and welcome to "It Mimcs". This is a project I've been working on for a few months based on the original Slenderman game (The Eight Pages)<br>
Built in UE5, It Mimics is a classic indie horror game exploring a moderate-sized map to collect eight different pages. Players will constantly be followed by a monster who never loses the player's trail. This requires players to time when they go into a certain area to retrieve each page. <br>
The game comes with three modes to play to provide some replayability if the player chooses. <br>
<br>
Night Mode - Night mode is the default and suggested game mode for the player. The entire game was designed around this game mode.<br>
<br>
Daytime mode - For those who want a brighter, yet still creepy experience, daytime provides the player with some beautiful sunshine. However, morning fog will do its best to block what light it can still. <br/>
<br/>
Challenge Mode - Based on the night mode, challenge mode spawns multiple monsters for the player to juggle and evade as they collect the pages. <br/>
<br/>
If you enjoy short indie horror games that are a bit of a walking/running experience, without the loud jumpscares, then I'm sure you're in for a treat.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Tenacious and musically gifted, Mari is everything a siren queen’s daughter ought to be. Except for the fact that her punk rock bloodsong power can make a simple melody more like a deadly explosive. With this weapon and sheer rebellious spirit, Mari seeks to escape her palace confines in order to headline her band's concert. Traversing through the cavernous dungeons might have been easy, if it weren’t for rogue enemies of a sleazy undersea shanty town thwarting her every move. Mari must rock on with her bloodsong, blast a few eardrums along the way, and get to her concert–before her queen mother’s army gets to her first.<br>
<br>
A twist on an action rhythm game, BLOODSONG entices players to use their musical pitch-matching ear as a form of combat. Listen to enemies’ bloodsongs–that is, their main musical melody–in order to learn how to defeat them. As you explore the atmospheric undersea world of the sirens, face off against biting anglerfish and cheeky crabs, all in order to get Mari to the stage. And prove, once and for all, that nothing is a match for teenage angst.						</br></br></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2717250/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							​A festive hangman type word game which is fun to play.<br>
<br>
Don't Melt the Snowman is a word game that is often played by one or more people. The game is a simple yet engaging way to test one's vocabulary and guessing skills. Here's how the game typically works:<br>
<br>
Setup: Don't Melt the Snowman will generate a word, based on a festive time of year, and keeps it a secret in its memory bank. The chosen word is usually related to a specific category, such as Christmas or other celebration.<br>
<br>
Melting the snowman: The original game traditionally involves drawing a gallows (a structure used for hangings) and an empty space for each letter of the chosen word. The number of spaces represents the number of letters in the word.  In Don't Melt the Snowman, the gallows are replaced by a Snowman figure that will slowly melt if your guess at a letter in the word is not successful.<br/>
<br/>
Guessing Letters: For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s) in the word, and the Snowman figure remains unchanged. For incorrect guesses, a different image of the Snowman is presented signifying a melting Snowman character.<br/>
<br/>
Limited Incorrect Guesses: As a player you will only have a limited number of incorrect guesses. If you exceed this limit before guessing the word correctly, you will lose the game and the Snowman will be completely melted - poor Snowman!<br/>
<br/>
Winning or Losing: The game continues until the word is guessed correctly, or the Snowman has melted. If the word is guessed successfully, you win that round and the choice to play again will be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
The original Hangman game, from which Don't Melt the Snowman is based upon, is a popular game for its simplicity and adaptability. It can be played with pen and paper, on a whiteboard, or through various online platforms. Additionally, it is often used as an educational tool to reinforce vocabulary and spelling skills.  Don't Melt the Snowman is an online platform with very much of a fun way of using word play!						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

It’s up to you, our daring beefcake hero, to bring justice to his doorstep, vanquish Randy’s diabolical forces, and cancel him… for good.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Story of Randy Blaster</h2><br/>Randy Blaster 3D’s chaotic development journey began in 2021 as a silly inside joke amongst friends. My buddy Randy (aka 3D BLAST), a popular figure in the vaporwave music scene, was hosting the #3DBLASTisOverParty, a roast-style Twitch stream where viewers would submit tongue-in-cheek videos or songs to “cancel” Randy once and for all.<br/><br/>At the time I was looking to experiment further with Unreal Engine and saw Randy’s stream as the perfect opportunity for some mischief. With only two weeks until the submission deadline, I had the idea to create a parody of a first person shooter game. . I found a basic UE4 template with simple mechanics and crude sprites that were perfect for some silly photoshopping! My initial photoshops weren’t too great, so I commissioned a talented sprite artist named Atina to create custom Randy enemy designs and environment sprites that set the tone. My concept: “Canceling Randy isn’t enough. He has to die!”<br/><br/>The date of Randy’s stream ended up getting pushed back significantly. Originally, I planned only to submit a brief video capture of the gameplay, but I saw the extended timeframe as a challenge and pushed myself to make Randy Blaster 3D fully playable.<br/><br/>In this early version, the player objective was to fight through Randy’s evil minions and gather his “vinyl records of power” to unlock new areas, eventually leading to the final boss: Randy himself. The platforming grew more intense in later levels as larger swarms of enemies pursued the player. The climax was a showdown with Randy himself! Easter egg cameos from vaporwave artists added surprise and flair. There was even a speedrun timer for competition with friends.<br/><br/>On stream day, it all hit me. I had created a complete, albeit short, retro FPS in just one month! To make things even more chaotic, the stream aired while I was moving from Virginia to California, and I caught the broadcast from an Oklahoma City hotel. The trailer (parodying a vintage Doom ad courtesy of our pal Discoholic) kicked things off strong. When Randy revealed the game was available for download, chat went wild! Randy played the game on stream for hours as viewers cheered on the zany carnage. This early version of Randy Blaster 3D still lives on itch.io as “The Bootleg Version.”<br/><br/>I pondered where to take things next. I adored the mechanics and wanted to bring Randy Blaster 3D to Steam, but this brief story mode didn’t seem substantial enough for a Steam release. After contemplation, I settled on creating a wave-based survival mode to add tons of replayability.<br/><br/>What followed was an explosion of new features over months of passionate work. More enemies, expanded mechanics, cunning AI, a robust progression system, elaborate level design, and the invention of what I call Deep Twitch Integration. Each step of the way I brainstormed wild ideas to make the game as fun and innovative as possible. Eventually, Randy Blaster 3D evolved into a polished, completely customizable, and novel FPS experience.<br/><br/>I was assisted by many incredible collaborators. <br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Atina, the skilled sprite artist whose visual creativity can be seen throughout the entire project.<br/></li><li>Prominent Quake mapper Kayne crafted the elaborate level design in the main castle level. <br/></li><li>I licensed renowned texture artist Makkon’s eyecatching environmental palettes. <br/></li><li>Christtt helped rework UI/UX and design concepts. His visage even made it into the game. See if you can find it! <br/></li><li>David Lamb for game testing and breaking things. <br/></li><li>Justin Higgs for assisting with website updates and validating UX. <br/></li><li>Randy himself voiced all the enemies and shopkeeper, Dandy Randy. He suggested the iconic air dash.<br/></li><li>The skilled musician Dial-up for Murder composed the perfect doom midi-inspired DJENT soundtrack. <br/></li><li>My talented girlfriend DATAGIRL handled all sound design and Wwise implementation - filling the world with character through audio.</li></ul><br/>Nearly 4 years have vanished in this development marathon. From a joke between friends to a passion project establishing my talents as an indie developer, I can only laugh looking back on all this effort creating such an unhinged game about battling my buddy Randy.<br/><br/>This journey was filled with unexpected twists and turns, but it led to creating something far more creative than I imagined. Every wild idea and late-night coding session was fueled by a desire to build an intensely fun and replayable experience alongside an awesome, collaborative team. At the end of the day, this has been a labor of love; a passion project creating something special for my friend and for the community we are a part of.<br/><br/>The work is not done, but the time has come to unleash this creation upon the world! I can't wait for friends to team up against Randy's forces and for streamers to engage their fans in new ways. My ultimate goal is to spread as many smiles as possible by fully embracing the chaos. Hopefully Randy Blaster 3D delivers a one-of-a-kind good time!						</div></div>]]></description>

You are about to hack into an airship crash survivor's brain and probe into his memories in order to uncover the horrible truth behind the incident.<h2 class="bb_tag">-About this game-</h2>–– Hello, detective. I'm your assistant Kate.<br/>To solve the case, we need you to hack into the brain of an airship crash survivor, and we will help you recreate his memories from one hour before the crash. You will act as the survivor himself, wandering through his memories. Within this hour, you must use all of your detective skills and think of every possible way to access every corner of his memories. You may listen in on discussions you believe are important, look for clues, and search for information related to suspicious persons in order to uncover the truth in a timely manner.<br/>Attention! Once the owner of the brain becomes aware of your presence, he will not only place numerous traps in his mind to stop you, but he will also create horrible illusions that trap you, and launch mind attacks to force you out of his head. It's rare for a beginner like you to last more than 10 minutes. If you feel you can't keep on, don't be a hero and notify me right away; I will cut the connection at any time and pull your consciousness out of his brain...This is entirely for your safety.<br/>Solving this case is both a commission from the Club and a rigorous test. The Club will award you with different levels of detective badges based on your performance. The highest honor is the exceedingly rare Star Detective badge, which can serve as your qualification to join the club. But, according to my research, no beginner detective has ever received this badge; will you be the lucky one?<br/>If you accept the challenge, please sign the commission agreement, and your mission will begin.<br/><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2644540/extras/hairu.jpg?t=1703487894"><h2 class="bb_tag">-How to play-</h2>Enjoying a feast of deduction in a crisis-ridden mind space<br/><br/>- An immersive crime investigation experience: We offer you a 360-degree immersive experience in an open crime scene, with dead bodies right at your feet!
