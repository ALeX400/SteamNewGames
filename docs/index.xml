<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>"Before the time of the giants, we lived freely under the Sun and Moon. Centuries have passed, but those stories of the surface world have been passed down through the generations. Now the giants are gone, and you, Vanguard, must venture out into the wilds once more, on an urgent mission. Be brave, and do not falter…"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/TreeLookingup.gif?t=1708009613"><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the vast “Land of the Small" </h2>Traverse lake sized puddles, scale skyscraper sized trees, scramble through cavernous cracks in roads, as you experience a huge open world from a new perspective. Explore dense forests, hazardous swamps and strange ruins left over from the time before. Uncover lore and knowledge from hidden NPCs scattered throughout the world and learn to survive in this vast wilderness. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Land_of_Small.gif?t=1708009613"><h2 class="bb_tag">Tame and ride creatures</h2>Uncover recipes that will let you tame and ride an array of critters. Leap huge distances on the back of a Grasshopper, zoom around on a Damselfly, scurry from place-to-place on a Spider. This world and its inhabitants are yours to conquer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Mounts.gif?t=1708009613"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survive together</h2>Play alongside friends with support for up to 10 players in multiplayer.

Weather conditions and seasons are in constant flux so if you want to survive for another day, preparation is key.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Survive_the_Wilds.gif?t=1708009613"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The legendary songs will carry you to the future.<br>
Announcing a new rhythm game in the Azure Striker Gunvolt series!<br>
<br>
■About "GUNVOLT RECORDS: Cychronicle"<br>

The notes flowing from the top of the screen come in various types: push the buttons to Tap Notes and Hold Notes, and move the sticks with Flick Notes and Slide Notes.<br/>
<br/>
When you're flicking in 8 different directions and sliding in arcs on the analog sticks, your movements will synchronize with the dancing divas in the background, just as if you were dancing along with them.<br/>
<br/>
■POINT 2: Including a sound player with full length vocals from the Muses!<br/>
All 15 included tracks and future planned DLC are selected from the vast library of acclaimed vocal tracks from the Gunvolt series, including tracks used in the series 5 games, CD-only releases, and Gunvolt animated feature. Listen to any of the music included in the game freely in the in-game music player.<br/>
<br/>
Use the included repeat and playlist functions to create your own listening mix!<br/>
<br/>
■POINT 3: The Muses add their charm and elegance!<br/>
The Muses, Lumen and Lola, alongside The Djinn, Luxia, dance with enchanting movement and provide their voices for a complete experience.<br/>
<br/>
Should repeated misses cause you to fail a song, their Anthem abilities will revive your run, allowing players of any skill level to enjoy the rhythm gameplay without worry.<br/>
<br/>
Cast<br/>
The Muse, Lumen: Megu Sakuragawa<br/>
The Muse, Lola: Mayu Mineda<br/>
The Djinn, Luxia: Rico Sasaki<br/>

<br/>
Different songs will feature various gameplay videos, giving series fans a nostalgic look at past experiences, and new fans a look into the games where the enchanting singers made their debuts.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, what do you mean we’re moving?!</h2>Just great; just when Inco was getting ready to move on into his Senior year, his parents decide to uproot his life and move half-way across the country!<br/><br/>Guess it’s time to start all over. Sure, Inco didn’t have many friends (or any) back at his old school, and sure, he was so low on the social ladder that he had to get a deep-sea diving lesson…. Wait, why was he complaining about moving again?<br/><br/>I Wani Hug that Gator is a multi-ended, choices-matter visual novel about second chances and the power of accepting who you are. Shape how Inco makes the most of his final year, and how the relationships he makes along the way will develop. One relationship in particular has him feeling all fuzzy inside…<h2 class="bb_tag">The Prehistoric Romance a Million-and-One Years in the making!</h2>If there’s one good thing to come out of Inco’s sudden relocation, it’s Olivia. Bold and brash, Olivia seems particularly gifted in getting under Inco’s skin. No matter how Inco slices it, he and Olivia seem destined to go together like a particularly scaly sandwich. But the outcome of such a pairing is yet to be determined…<h2 class="bb_tag">Wait, am I being graded on this?!</h2>Make friends, reconcile enemies, and figure out how Inco could possibly repair his miserable excuse for a social life.  But be warned: The choices you make expands the relationships with Inco’s classmates and determines which of the four unique endings you receive. Maybe Inco should’ve spent a little less time studying and a bit more time learning how to relate to people…						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. <br/><br/>Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat1.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat1.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in an eccentric art style and a mystical soundtrack from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling.       <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat2.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat2.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths.  <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/EN-Ultros-feat3.png?t=1707822049"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2386310/extras/steam_feat3.gif?t=1707822049"><br/>The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS. Each loop brings you closer to the truth...						</img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Hellcard</strong> is a <strong>cooperative roguelike deckbuilder</strong> that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book of Demons, and its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced tactical card battles. <br/><br/>If you are excited about <strong>HELLCARD</strong>, be sure to <strong>wishlist </strong>the game on Steam. Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/>What makes <strong>HELLCARD</strong> unique and different from other deck-building games is that <strong>monster placement actually matters</strong> and can be used to your advantage.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif4_600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>HELLCARD</strong> supports <strong>co-op battles</strong> with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In <strong>singleplayer mode</strong>, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In <strong>multiplayer mode</strong>, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif1-2-3-600.gif?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/r2g_logo_fixed.png?t=1706878477"><br/><br/><strong>Return 2 Games</strong> is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

In the spirit of that, each ATARI PRESENTS title is presented unchanged from its original version other than providing the means to play them on modern hardware. Even the store description below is the very same language used to describe the title at the time of its release. Please enjoy!<h2 class="bb_tag">HardBall!</h2><br/>Have you ever gone to a Major League ballpark before most of the fans show up, when the ball players are taking batting practice? If you walked down in front of the box seats, right alongside the warning track, you had to be dumbstruck by the immensity of the entire playing field: crisp, white lines of chalk cutting to foul poles that reach to the sky, a freshly cut outfield of brilliant green that seems to stretch forever and images of exciting things to come as great athletes prepare for their version of modern day coliseum warfare.<br/><br/><strong>Dirty Uniforms</strong><br/><br/>That’s exactly what you get from HardBall, baseball that’s so real and true-to-life, it’s like you can reach out and touch it. It’s like the Saturday afternoon “Game of the Week” on network television – NO, it’s better because you don’t just sit there, you play HardBall. In fact, HardBall is so real and lifelike, if you wear a uniform while you play it, you just might get it dirty. It’s quite simply the most spectacular sports simulation computer game of all time. See you in Cooperstown!<br/><br/>The batter hits a sure single. But, with his team behind late in the game, should he try and stretch it into a double? You decide. At this stage, you’re either a hero or a goat.<br/><br/>It’s the bottom of the 9th and the league’s most feared slugger prepares to tee off on the next offering from the home team’s ace fireballer. Will it be high or low, a curve or a screwball?<br/><br/>The game has gone into extra innings, all tied up. Do you pinch-hit for the weak hitting pitcher or leave him in because he's the best you've got?<h2 class="bb_tag">HardBall II:</h2><br/>It's a whole new ballgame.<br/><br/>HardBall II retains the all-star qualities of the original. Effortless gameplay. Authentic graphics. Unparalleled realism. But now there's more. Much more. More features and options More choices, playability and true-to-ballplayer animation. Even more major league ballparks. Scout around and compare. You'll find that HardBall II isn't just the best computer baseball game on the market. It's in a league by itself.<br/><br/><strong>Statistics don't tell the whole story.</strong> Better than the morning box scores. HardBallII updates and stores stats in virtually every conceivable category. Stats change from at-bat to at-bat, from game to game. Plus there are other new features, like pick offs, league play, a team editor - even fielding errors. Whew.<br/><br/><strong>More frames of animation means more realism.</strong> Feel the heat of a 90 mpg fastball. With increased frames of animation, each pitch, each play, is major league smooth. More choices means the pitcher can come to the plate or attempt to pick the runner off at second. Caught learning? Try to stay alive in a rundown.<br/><br/><strong>Shift the infield and outfield according to each hitter.</strong> The centerfield view offers a scout's insight as to the hitter's tendencies. Will you play at normal depth, guard the lines or put on a custom shift? Remember, the batter has options as well. He may go to right, bunt or drill it over your head.<br/><br/><strong>Seven different stadiums. Five different views.</strong> Step on the turf of seven familiar big league ballparks. Catch the game from five network TV field perspectives: upper deck overview, behind the pitcher, behind the plate or left and right infield views. The "Game Of The Week" crew would be proud.<br/><br/><strong>TV Instant Replay feature.</strong> Want to start a bench clearing brawl? Then show your opponent that triple you just belted, one more time, with the Instant Replay feature. You can pause it, play it at normal speed, slow motion or - if you really want to rub it in - frame-by-frame.<br/><br/><strong>Pull-down menus make managing easy:</strong> A winning manager pushes all the right buttons. Pencil in a starting line-up based on who's going good. And if they start going bad? Pull the starters and pinch hit. Feel like trading all of these bums? Go ahead You can build your very own dream team with the team editor feature.						</div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							ATARI PRESENTS is a series of titles geared toward the preservation of cult classics, forgotten favorites, and titles that would otherwise be lost to time. In the spirit of that, each ATARI PRESENTS title is presented unchanged from its original version other than providing the means to play them on modern hardware. Even the store description below is the very same language used to describe the title at the time of its release. Please enjoy!<br>
<br>
Imagine yourself in a world full of nightmares with Dali-esque creatures and mind-eating eyes. Picture yourself in an upside down landscape. Alone in a weird dream and wondering... what the... ?!<br>
<br>
Imported from England, this is the computer game that everyone is talking about - or soon will be - in excited whispers and bewildered exclamations.<br>
<br>
It's the game with the soccer ball that devours knife-wielding little girls... then burps.<br/>
<br/>
The one with totem pole heads hopping on kangaroo bodies under skies full of fish.<br/>
<br/>
The one with a giant killer bee that wants your cotton candy, the grandfather clock that points the way, and the lawn mower than grinds you to a bloody pulp.<br/>
<br/>
Like the famous ink-plot test, the bizarre scenes, puzzle and arcade style challenges in Weird Dreams will mean different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
Some will think them uproariously funny.<br/>
<br/>
Others will think them strange and unsettling.<br/>
<br/>
Still others will be outright offended.<br/>
<br/>
Decide for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
One thing is certain: there has never been a computer game like Weird Dreams. You have to play it to believe it. <br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
'Weird Dreams is a cinematic, third-person platform game with action and puzzle elements. The game contains bizarre levels and unorthodox activities, including feeding a wasp cotton candy, beating up hopping totem poles with fish from the sky, and an encounter with a baked chicken in a haunted house. The game comes with a "short novel" that explains the plot in detail and serves as copy protection.' - MobyGames						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

    Speedsters are characters who can run or fly at superhuman speeds, usually with resistance to the side effects of moving at high speed. The term is mostly used in superhero comics, where speedsters often have a special energy source that enables them to move at fantastic speeds, such as the Speed Force in DC Comics1. Some of the most famous speedsters are:<br>
<br/>
The Flash: The superhero name of several characters in DC Comics, who can tap into the Speed Force and manipulate time and space. The most well-known Flash is Barry Allen, who is also part of the Arrowverse TV shows2.<br/>
<br/>
Quicksilver: The mutant son of Magneto in Marvel Comics, who can move faster than sound and has enhanced reflexes and durability. He is also a member of the Avengers and the X-Men, and has appeared in both the MCU and the Fox X-Men movies.<br/>
<br/>
Sonic the Hedgehog: The iconic video game character from Sega, who can run faster than the speed of sound and curl into a ball to attack enemies. He is also the star of several animated shows, comics, and a live-action movie.<br/>
<br/>
There are many more speedsters in popular culture, each with their own origin, abilities, and personality. Some of them are heroes, some are villains, and some are somewhere in between. They are often very exciting and fun to watch, as they can perform amazing feats and overcome impossible odds with their speed.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>
