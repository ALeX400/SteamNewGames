      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">A lively parade with hololive VTubers and mascot characters!</h2><br/>"HoloParade" is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for "holo Indie". Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It's a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.<br/><br/>What is "holo Indie"?:<br/>It is a general term for a game brand for derivative work games, produced using the "game creator support program" with the aim of co-creating with fans and creators of hololive Production around the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 1: Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</h2>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy's base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.<br/><br/>Additionally, there's an element inspired by parades called the 'Symphony Effect,' where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Battle.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 2: Comprehensive Development Elements</h2>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a 'Skill' system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Skill_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 3: No Gacha Purchases, No Stamina System</h2>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.<br/><br/>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Gacha_ENG.gif?t=1701417555"><h2 class="bb_tag">Feature 4: Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</h2>When you return to the office, the home screen, you'll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/Home_ENG.png?t=1701417555"><br/><br/>Additionally, mini-games with entirely different gameplay from the main story are implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. At the initial release, a mini-game titled "Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!" is available, where Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with hololive) who overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles. More mini-games are planned to be added in future updates.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2647230/extras/RunMikoti.gif?t=1701417555"> </img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Slice, dice, and serve justice cold with the return of Chef, hold the front line and shield your team as Enforcer, or lay down a path of toxic sludge as everybody’s favorite purple monster: Acrid! Forge new paths to explore with 15 unique Survivors, each with new abilities to master. Two entirely new Survivors are making their debut in Risk of Rain Returns.<br/><br/>Also introducing The Drifter! This resourceful brawler gathers scrap from conquered foes and can spawn items that temporarily empower teammates. She can also take them for herself and unleash an unbridled blaze of area-wide destruction. The Drifter is the perfect addition to any group of Survivors. Her ability to support the team while laying down her own brand of hurt will prove she’s more than just a stowaway.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/06_place_holder_gif.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/07_Play_Solo_Or_Gather_Crew_615x200.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Drop to the surface solo or with your crew! Choose Survivors that complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, or go wild and choose whoever has the largest guns (spoiler: it’s Loader). With up to four-player online and couch co-op, you’re not alone in this fight. <br/><br/>Risk of Rain Returns features new and improved multiplayer services to ensure the only thing that gets between your crew’s survival are the ever-growing hordes on Petrichor V.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/08_Gif_of_survivors_jumping_out_Desolate_Forest_zoomed_in.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/09_Potent_Pick-Ups_Header.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Fight your way to the surface while uncovering precious cargo. These items serve as your redemption, helping you move faster, deal more damage, or jump a little higher. Still others empower you in more dramatic ways—like the rare Ukulele, which empowers your attacks with electrifying music. <br/><br/>If explosions are what you’re after, hunt down the Brilliant Behemoth and watch as even your most mundane attacks erupt in a barrage of beautiful blasts. The magic comes in the unpredictable combinations you create. Exploding chain lightning is only the beginning of your frenetic masterpiece!<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/10_Potent_Pick_Ups___fireboots_2.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/11_Header_The_Dangers_of_Petrichor_V.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>The denizens of Petrichor V are as diverse as the many planets they once called home. As these monsters approached extinction on their own worlds, a mysterious force brought them to Petrichor V. The planet quickly grew to be a menagerie of the most dangerous monsters in the galaxy, and they’re not thrilled by interlopers (aka YOU).<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/12_Diversity_of_Environment.gif?t=1699995226"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/13_rule_bending_artifacts.gif?t=1699995226"><br/>Variety is the spice of destruction. Select from more than 10 Artifacts that each mutate your run! Perhaps you’d like to start with a random equipment item that changes every time it’s used, or maybe you’d like to experience a rampant Imp invasion every 10 minutes. Play around with combinations of Artifacts and discover exciting new ways to play.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1337520/extras/14_place_holder_gif_3_possible_artifact.gif?t=1699995226"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							It was once your grandfather’s pride-and-joy, but your family ranch has fallen on hard times and it’s up to you to turn things around. Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_DemolishGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Rebuild Your Ranch</h2><br/>The years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs you’ll need to keep them safe and secure.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_ChickensGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Look After Your Livestock</h2><br/>Grand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? That’ll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work.<br/><br/>Expand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1119730/extras/Ranch_Sim_HuntingGIF.gif?t=1700474352"><h2 class="bb_tag">Head Out on the Hunt</h2><br/>There’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you aren’t the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood. Sometimes your steady hand and sharp eyes will also be needed back on the ranch to stop hungry wolves turning your off-grid dream into a nightmare.<br/><br/>Play the game PCGamesN calls "House Flipper meets Red Dead Redemption 2"!						</img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<h2 class="bb_tag">MAIN FEATURES</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>100 microlevels that can be displayed inverted horizontally or vertically, as the game sees fit, arranged randomly in each game thanks to a super-secret algorithm.<br/></li><li>Fast-paced and addictive gameplay, perfect for experiencing intense and fleeting moments of fun.<br/></li><li>A soundtrack that becomes more complex based on your progress.<br/></li><li>Over ten unlockable skins throughout the game.<br/></li><li>Controls that may be challenging at first but, theoretically, you'll master in just a few minutes.<br/></li><li>The option to play in an absolutely minimalist style by deactivating backgrounds, shadows, and even decorative objects.<br/></li><li>Some other features that you'll have to discover for yourself.</li></ul><br/>And always remember! You may encounter:<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Levels that seem much more difficult than they really are.<br/></li><li>Levels that are more challenging than they initially appear.<br/></li><li>Levels so easy they'll make you suspicious.<br/></li><li>Levels that will make you ponder a little.<br/></li><li>Levels that will make you believe the game is broken.<br/></li><li>And other levels too.</li></ul><br/>Do you really want to know more? Well, keep reading, and I'll tell you my life...<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/anim1op.gif?t=1701748966"><h2 class="bb_tag">THE TRIBUTE</h2>As a child, I had the tremendous luck of having generous parents who gifted me a brand new Spectrum, a device that provided me with countless hours of fascination and entertainment with games filled with impossible levels. This game -my personal passion project for the past few years - is meant to pay tribute to that wonderful era of the early personal computers, the first arcades, and the first consoles.<br/><br/><br/>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash1.gif?t=1701748966">  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash2.gif?t=1701748966">  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash1.gif?t=1701748966"><h2 class="bb_tag">THE TWIST</h2>Although I was and still am passionate about games, I was not -and am not- extremely skilled at playing them. One of the things I have always hated the most is having to start over and over again from the beginning. That's why in SUPER RETRO RETRY the order of the one hundred levels changes each time, and due to this small change, another one emerged almost organically, which might seem much more drastic: the player has only one life. When there's no monotonous need to repeat the same levels again and again, the number of lives becomes almost irrelevant. Once you master the game, one life is enough to overcome all obstacles.<br/><br/><br/>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash2.gif?t=1701748966">  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash1.gif?t=1701748966">  <img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/flash2.gif?t=1701748966"><h2 class="bb_tag">THE DISCLAIMER</h2>When it came to developing the game, finding the right level of difficulty was quite challenging. I wanted the game to be challenging but not frustrating, and to convey to the player the feeling that overcoming the levels was always possible. What I didn't want, under any circumstances, was to artificially inflate the difficulty or unnecessarily lengthen the game. That's why an experienced player should not take more than a few minutes to complete it, although I trust that reaching that goal for the first time will take much longer.<br/><br/><i>- J. Pablo Ruiz "NetDancer"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/animdusty.gif?t=1701748966"><br/><br/><br/>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2648560/extras/srr.png?t=1701748966"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/verticality_screenshot.png?t=1701702083"><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/what_is.png?t=1701702083"><br/>Conclave is a simple and intuitive way to take your TTRPG campaign to the next level, whether your group is playing in the same room or scattered across the realms.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/fog.gif?t=1701702083"><br/><br/>Conclave is all about the experience, not the numbers. There's no managing stats or fiddling with complex mazes of menus; we'll assume you've already got the character sheets covered. Instead, we aim to provide a customizable space with easy and straightforward tools for you to build and play out your sessions.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/proficiency.png?t=1701702083"><br/>Conclave includes an array of tools to help you on your journey, including dice, measuring tools, status effects, and a fog painting system. We've included some assets to get you started, but this is your game; your story. Who are we to decide what's in it? You can quickly and easily import everything you need for your session: maps, tokens, portraits, and even 3D minis!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/hero-forge.png?t=1701702083"><br/>Conclave supports the Hero Forge® Access Key, meaning you can connect your account to unlock your library of customized digital miniatures. You'll unlock 5 free minis when you connect your account!<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/time_of_day.gif?t=1701702083"><br/><br/>Change time of day, lighting, and even weather and nature effects to get the vibe you want. Conclave's minimalist design means it gets out of the way when you need it to so players can focus on the story and experience you're building together.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/collaborative.png?t=1701702083"><br/>Conclave aims to not only replicate the classic tabletop gaming experience, but also enhance it, and make it easier than ever to get your group together. Conclave is built with local multiplayer in mind, so players in the same room can simply pass a controller or two around. Online players needn't worry though, as Conclave fully supports Steam's Remote Play Together service. With just a single copy of Conclave, the whole party can play and create together.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/dice_battle.gif?t=1701702083"><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/house.png?t=1701702083"><br/>Conclave is designed primarily to facilitate tabletop RPGs, but there's no rule that says you can't branch out. If it involves moving pieces on a board, there's probably a good chance you can play it with Conclave.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2373800/extras/checkers.gif?t=1701702083"><br/><br/>We invite you to join our growing Discord community, where you can look for a group, talk about your campaign, or just chat with us. We're looking forward to being a part of your next adventure.						</img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Beta testers have said:<br/><i>"The gameplay is addictive and almost meditative."<br/>"I would describe it as Skyrim meeting Diablo."<br/>"A game with a soul, finally something unique and refreshing in a sea of similar games."</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Ever-changing world</h2>In Svarog's Dream, you will have absolute freedom to explore the world and make decisions.<br/>However, freedom comes with consequences; over time, your actions will shape the world around you, either for the better or worse.<h2 class="bb_tag">Soul lost between worlds</h2>You start as a lost soul, and you will inhabit human hosts who are desperate enough to accept you. With each death, you will revisit the underworld and return through new characters with their unique backgrounds and talents.<h2 class="bb_tag">A pawn in the game of Gods</h2>While humans are waging their wars on Earth, the Gods are battling each other in the sky.  <br/>Their power is immense; however, everyone is bound to the threads of destiny, except for you. <br/>You possess a valuable power—the power of free will—and because of that, <br/>the gods will see you as an important piece and will try to persuade you to join their side.<br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004640/extras/BogoviBaner14.png?t=1701697882"><br/><br/><strong>The old prophecy:</strong> <br/><i>"Svarog, the first god, created six worlds and fell asleep.<br/>In his dream, he created the seventh world, Earth.<br/>Once he wakes up, Earth will cease to exist."</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Immersive gameplay</h2>In Svarog's Dream, you will discover over a hundred quests, more than a hundred unique abilities, and over five hundred unique items. <br/>You will have to eat, cook, sleep, craft potions, upgrade gear, buy houses, take loans, and even evade debt collectors or headhunters, and much more.<br/>We have done our best to make the world around you feel alive and responsive to your decisions.						</img></div></div>]]></description>
