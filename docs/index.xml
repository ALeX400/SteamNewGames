<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i><strong>Based on Sea Dogs series and inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!</strong></i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/История_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Welcome to the Caribbean in 1654 AD, a place teeming with opportunities and mysteries. Assume the role of Charles de Maure, a young French noble who embarked on a journey to the New World to assist his brother. What initially appeared to be a simple family matter quickly evolves into a lifelong adventure.<br/>Immerse yourself in the tale of a noble brat who rises to become the most influential figure in the Caribbean. <strong>Riches, titles, power, and romance – the ultimate booty awaits, and it's up to you to seize it all.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/steamchar.jpg?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Embark on a 200-hour-long journey.<br/></li><li>Undertake hundreds of quests.<br/></li><li>Freeplay, rush through the story, or combine both - you're the Captain, and your ship will sail where you command.<br/></li><li>Experience a historical narrative with a touch of mystique.<br/></li><li>Explore romantic interests and companions.<br/></li><li>Choose from various career options, from general-governor to pirate baron.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Мир_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>The Caribbean Sea – a realm of dozens of islands and cities, a grand archipelago shrouded in mystery and secrets. From the summits of Indian pyramids to the ocean depths, unique rewards, quests, and curiosities await. <strong>This open world is your sandbox, you are free to explore it and shape your legend as you see fit. </strong>Your decisions determine where to go, what to do, and who to take with you. Subdue the New World or it will destroy you!<br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Discover dozens of islands and settlements.<br/></li><li>Build your very own colony.<br/></li><li>Explore caves, pyramids, jungles, Indian tribes, and lost cities.<br/></li><li>Visit taverns, brothels, shipyards, churches, forts, and many other points of interest.<br/></li><li>Engage in treasure hunting and gambling.<br/></li><li>Experience dynamic weather and the serene turquoise sea.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/Море_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><strong>Owning a warship is a privilege, a symbol of status and luxury. </strong>You are among the very few who can afford such grandeur. Begin your journey with a simple sloop and work your way up to commanding a ship of the line or even a fleet of these formidable vessels, ready to plunder cities at your whim. No one will stand in your way. Tired from leading massive armadas and the responsibility? Take command of a fast Frigate or Corvette and just free roam the Caribbean. In moments of tranquility at sea, relish the stunning views, embrace the sense of exploration, or navigate in the heart of a storm.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/valciria3_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Command dozens of ships representing the glory of the Age of Sail.<br/></li><li>Customize, paint, upgrade, and repair your vessel.<br/></li><li>Engage in unforgiving yet enjoyable naval combat.<br/></li><li>Experience intense boarding action, from the upper deck to the captain's cabin.<br/></li><li>Collect unique vessels to rule the seas.<br/></li><li>Manage booty distribution, morale, and the threat of mutinies.<br/></li><li>Assemble a formidable team of officers.</li></ul><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/боевка_EN.gif?t=1708341012"><br/><br/>Captains are most vulnerable when they set foot on land. Surviving naval combat can be challenging, but at least you won't die alone – your crew will stand with you till the very end. Land battles are different: dishonest, ruthless and risky for you and those who you hold dear. <strong>Bring your companions with you, poison your weapons, study the terrain, craft deadly items, and confront thugs, soldiers, pirates, and rivals head-on.</strong><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2230980/extras/face_201_копия.png?t=1708341012"><br/><br/><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tailor your character's build – become a heavy swordsman, a nimble rogue, a master sharpshooter, or a silver-tongued diplomat.<br/></li><li>Equip yourself and your companions with a wide array of swords, axes, rapiers, armor, muskets, and pistols.<br/></li><li>Craft amulets, ammo, potions, and always be prepared for battle.<br/></li><li>Seek out challenges – the more you fight, the stronger both you and your character become.<br/></li><li>Command military operations from raiding to sieges.</li></ul> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<i>"Before the time of the giants, we lived freely under the Sun and Moon. Centuries have passed, but those stories of the surface world have been passed down through the generations. Now the giants are gone, and you, Vanguard, must venture out into the wilds once more, on an urgent mission. Be brave, and do not falter…"</i><br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/TreeLookingup.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the vast “Land of the Small" </h2>Traverse lake sized puddles, scale skyscraper sized trees, scramble through cavernous cracks in roads, as you experience a huge open world from a new perspective. Explore dense forests, hazardous swamps and strange ruins left over from the time before. Uncover lore and knowledge from hidden NPCs scattered throughout the world and learn to survive in this vast wilderness. <br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Land_of_Small.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Tame and ride creatures</h2>Uncover recipes that will let you tame and ride an array of critters. Leap huge distances on the back of a Grasshopper, zoom around on a Damselfly, scurry from place-to-place on a Spider. This world and its inhabitants are yours to conquer.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Mounts.gif?t=1708077077"><h2 class="bb_tag">Survive together</h2>Play alongside friends with support for up to 10 players in multiplayer.

Weather conditions and seasons are in constant flux so if you want to survive for another day, preparation is key.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/768200/extras/Survive_the_Wilds.gif?t=1708077077"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/881020/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Story<br/>
Granblue Fantasy takes place in the Sky Realm, a world where myriad islands float in a great blue expanse. Take your role as captain of a skyfaring crew, joined by a scrappy little dragon named Vyrn and a young girl with mysterious powers named Lyria. Together you sail with a colorful cast of crewmates, including kings and misfits alike, for Estalucia, a fabled island beyond the end of the skies.<br/>
<br/>
In the Zegagrande Skydom, islands are guarded by powerful creatures known as primal beasts and winds carry tales of a secretive organization known as the Church of Avia. Unveil a web of intrigue reaching far beyond the borders of Zegagrande and engage in a battle for the fate of the Sky Realm itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay<br/>
Engage in real-time combat with a party of four in this character action RPG—choose from a diverse roster of skyfarers, each with their own unique weapons, skills, and combat styles. Teamwork makes the dream work with party-based mechanics such as Link Attacks and Chain Bursts to help you crush foes in spectacular fashion. Tackle quests solo or with the help of others for up to 4-player co-op and take down treacherous foes to score rare loot to further enhance your gear. Every enemy and party formation has its own strengths and weaknesses—the key to victory lies in working out how these pieces fit together.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-paced combat not your thing? Assist modes can provide accessibility for gamers of all skill levels. Toggle on Full Assist to have all actions performed automatically during battle!<br/>
<br/>
The Sky Realm is rich in lore and history. Browse Lyria's journal at any point during the game to access a trove of writings on the world's peoples, places, and more. In addition to the wealth of side quests available, Fate Episodes allow you to delve into the backstories of each member of your crew!						</div></div>]]></description>

      <title>Dominions 6 - Rise of the Pantokrator</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2511500/header.jpg" /><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<h2>About This Game</h2>
							You are a God! You are master and ruler of a loyal nation. You have unimaginable powers at your disposal. You have claimed this world as yours. But there are others who stand in your way. You must defeat and destroy these pretenders. Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator.<br>
<br>
Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player.  Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once.  The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play.<br>
<br>
In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play.<br>
<br>
When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game.<br/>
<br/>
The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim.<br/>
<br/>
The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. <br/>
<br/>
A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units.<br/>
<br/>
Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations. <br/>
<br/>
There are also a number of changes intended to ease gameplay.						</br></br></br></br></br></br></div></div>]]></description>

Make sure the charging process runs smoothly.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/nice_system.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Responsibilities</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Design and implement efficient battery charging systems.<br/></li><li> Innovate and solve complex puzzles on dozens of diverse production lines.<br/></li><li> Recycle energy bullets to earn the company Eco Credits.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Benefits</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Unique job description: a mixture of puzzle, automation, and tower defense.<br/></li><li> Creative freedom: solve the production lines your own way.<br/></li><li> Chance to work with a revolutionary tower charging system: only one tower shoots, and the others transform the bullets.<br/></li><li> Time is not a limit: Rewind and fast-forward to any production phase and work at your own tempo.<br/></li><li> High safety standards: No employee, visitor, or other being gets hurt. (Violence-free)<br/></li><li> Procedural and customizable tower-generated soundtrack: Each tower system emits a characteristic melody.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Qualifications</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Proficient in puzzle-solving and automation techniques.<br/></li><li> Strong problem-solving skills with a creative approach to challenges.<br/></li><li> Proven track record in designing and optimizing production systems.<br/></li><li> Not afraid of free-flying bullets.<br/></li><li> Experience in tower defense or analogous strategic fields is a plus.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Battery charging process step by step</strong></h2>Our battery factory uses a revolutionary charging process: shooting the batteries with energy bullets. While this system entails some inherent risks, it has proven to be extremely efficient.<h2 class="bb_tag">Energizing and recycling bullets</h2>The <strong>Bullet Tower</strong> shoots basic bullets that don't carry much energy. It is, therefore, desirable to energize them in <strong>Energy Towers</strong> before they hit batteries. It is also useful to recycle bullets that do not hit any battery in the <strong>Eco Tower</strong>. This earns the company <strong>Eco Credits</strong> and keeps environmentalists at arm's length.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/charging.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Changing bullet direction</h2>Due to the complicated layouts of our factory floors, it is often necessary to change the bullet path to avoid an obstacle. This can be achieved by <strong>Bend Towers</strong> that change the bullet's direction by 90 degrees.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/bending.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Splitting bullets</h2>Building multiple <strong>Bullet Towers</strong> to increase the number of bullets in circulation can be quite expensive. So here's an alternative: <strong>Split Tower</strong> takes an already existing bullet on the input and splits it into three bullets with reduced energy.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/splitting.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Fusing bullets</h2>To create the most powerful bullets, it is necessary to utilize the <strong>Fuse Tower</strong> that fuses the energies of three incoming bullets into one. The combined bullet has very <strong>high energy</strong> and pierces through batteries instead of being destroyed. This way, only a fraction of the energy will be used for charging, and the rest will pierce through.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/fuse_and_pierce.gif?t=1708359897"><h2 class="bb_tag">Routing bullets</h2>The <strong>Junction Tower</strong> is quite versatile and can be used in various situations. It can chain bullet streams, fuse them, and perform complex bullet-routing tasks. Furthermore, the routing direction can be switched when hit from the side with the lever.<br/><br/><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2128590/extras/switching.gif?t=1708359897"> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div></div>]]></description>

Sub-tables are rolled and displayed automatically.<br/><br/>In addition, you are allowed to reroll the whole results, certain results but also even partially reroll certain words until you get exactly what you were looking for.<br/>A vast list of tables awaits you to generate anything you like, and all of them are written by award-winning author Matt Finch and Mythmere games.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>The Notebook &amp; Exports</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2537290/extras/Table_Designer.gif?t=1708354646"><br/><br/>You will be able to use the Adventure Design Tool interactively, generating results from several linked tables all at once.
